Devil is the enemy of God

Eph 6:12 

-Devil is the ruler of darkness,deceiver, devour the weak, sabotage the church, go against God’s people.

-The most fearful aspect of devil is its snares, its deceit. 1 Jn 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is of the world

-These are the tools that the devil will use and it starts from the heart. James 1:14 We are tempted by our own desires –lust of eyes, lust of the flesh & pride of life

-If within our hearts, we do not have these desires, then the devil cannot touch us.

-Prayer of testing does not please God. 

-Within the heart where there is pride of life, whereby submission to advice is unheeded, then this gives opportunity to the devil to work.
Job 1: 9-11 Satan said man fear God because they have protection of God and will leave God if there are disaster. 

-When the trial of faith happens, we need to overcome it. 

-Trials faced -Eg a newly believed family member received cancer. A newly baptized member had an accident & was nearly blind. Yet he patiently and continued to hold on to his faith.

-Devil will use sickness, disaster to tempt believers of God. If we know that these are trials and can overcome this, it will be good .

- We need to be vigilant to build our faith to overcome all trials.
Mt 24:11,24 These are the attacks of the devil by using false Christ & prophets.
2 Cor 11:13-16 False apostles, deceitful workers disguised as workers of Christ

-We have to be vigilant of these deceitful workers.

-Today our church workers/preachers do not accept any money but donation is directly to the General Assembly.
James 3: 13-16 Disorder/Dissention  is another attack from the devil. 

-When there is growth, expansion, this is the time the devil will work.

-If there are grievances, unjust feelings, disagreements, these can be used by the devil to attack.

-When we have negative feelings, or disputes, we have to calm ourselves down so that we are not used by the devil.

-The important thing is to preserve the unity of members despite of  any disagreements.

-We have to remind ourselves not to be used as a tool of the devil. We have to be vigilant.

-Because of our disagreement, our opinions, our temper these can  be used by the devil to divide the church

-We have to be vigilant and pray.

-Mt 26:41 Watch and pray so that you will not be led into temptation. 

-To watch and pray is the best tool to fight against the devil in any divine work.

-By being watchful, we can notice the snares of the devil, be vigilant of the wiles of the devil’s temptations.

-James 4:7 Submit to God and the devil will flee. 

-Submit to God is to submit to God’s words. Today to submit, is also to submit  the decision of the church in the name of Jesus.

-There is nothing right or wrong except on bible doctrines.

-Phil 2: 3 Do nothing from selfishness or conceit but in humility count others better than yourselves.  

-How to be humble? Willing to be submissive and can submit what we are told. 

-Real submissiveness is within our hearts. Willing to work without any recognition.

-A deaconesss does not talk much but she does much. She does work quietly eg cleaning, visiting, even though her position in the society is high.

Heb 3: 14 Hold fast to the end so that we can withhold the attacks of the devil.
