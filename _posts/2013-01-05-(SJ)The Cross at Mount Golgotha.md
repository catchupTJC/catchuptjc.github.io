 Mt Golgotha was a place where criminals were nailed on the cross

Gal 3:13  The cross was considered as accursed. This is the cup that Jesus Christ has to take.

-Mt 26:39, 42 This is the cup that JC has to take. This cup is Mt Golgotha. It is a place of suffering and the cross is considered accursed. It is a bitter cup as it is a cup of suffering.
-Jesus prayed, “if it is possible, let this cup passed from me.” 

Luke 9:23 If you want to follow Jesus, you need to deny yourself and bear the cross which is to bear the pain/suffering for the sake of JC.

-Are we to bear this pain and suffering for Jesus? When we resolve to live for Jesus, we need to bear this cross for Jesus.

-Today the cross is a symbol of love and no more a symbol of suffering.

-Jn 3:16 Life of JC in exchange of our lives. This is the love of God. God gave his only begotten son. For our sake, he sacrificed his life for us. 

-The poor widow gave 2 of her coins. She gave up all that she had. Nobody forced her to give up all that she had. That is why Jesus praised the poor widow.

- It is not the amount you offer but how much of your love of JC that you have for him

-When we see the cross, how much do you feel the love of JC that he has for you when you take the holy communion?

-How do we love God?-By loving our brethren.

1 Jn 4:10-11 Let us love our brothers & sisters. How? 1 Cor 13 is what we have to do to manifest love.

The cross is the sign of salvation & no longer a symbol of curse

Jn 19:30 “It is finished” JC has completed his work of salvation. The sufferings that he has to undergo for our sake has finished.

-Today we are saved through the sacrifice & death of Jesus. The book of Revelation also states “It is finished” The salvation plan is truly completed.  

-We are now still living under the salvation plan, maintaining our faith. When we breathe our last, then we have finished our path of salvation in our lives.

-If we believe in JC but cannot follow the teachings of JC, no works eventhough you have faith, you have not complete the salvation plan.

1 Cor 15:55-57 The victory of JC death is to overcome death. Being victorious over death is to overcome sin. 
Examine ourselves whether we truly have overcome our sins when we take our Holy Communion. We need to repent and resolve for JC. 

Holy Communion (HC)

1 Cor 11:27-29 HC is to remember JC death. We are observing a spiritual Passover. Ex 12:43,46 The conditions of Passover.
1)	No foreigner shall eat it. Those who have yet to be baptized, to refrain from taking HC. 
2)	Vs 46: Partake inside in the house - ie it cannot be taken home but must be taken in the church
3)	Examine ourselves
