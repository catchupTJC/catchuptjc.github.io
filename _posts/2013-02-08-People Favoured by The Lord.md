Mk 10:13-16, Luke 18 Parents who brought their children to Jesus that he might lay hands & bless them. When the disciples rebuked them , Jesus was indignant and told the disciples to allow the children to come to him for to such belongs the kingdom of God

Prov 20:11 Even a child makes himself known by his acts, whether what he does is pure and right. 

-We should pursue to be pure, holy and upright separate from the world. Similar to the attributes of a child, pure and right.

Mt 18:1-4 Unless you turn & become to be children, you will never enter heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

-Children have a character to just listen and obey. They are submissive. 

-Similarly we also must have these traits of listening, obeying and be submissive to the words of God regardless of the status, age as long as the words of God is spoken. We must humble ourselves to be able to do this. 

-Luke 19 Zacchaeus climbed up the tree to see Jesus. He was a rich man and did not lack in anything yet he desired to look for JC. Jesus saw his heart and told him that he will be coming to his house.

-Rev 3:17 Church of Laodicea was lukewarm yet they perceived that there were rich and felt no need to improve themselves. ---Rev 3:20  People who are in need will open their hearts to allow JC to come in.

-Zacchaeus was actually empty in his heart and sought JC which JC wanted to go to his house to fill his emptiness

-James 4:8 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.

-Jer 29:13 you will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. Jesus loves those who like to pursue him, to draw near him

Jn 1:43-49  Nathanael said to Philip, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” We should not speak too directly but it is important to consider first before speaking. 

- Jesus love Nathanael because his heart had no guile or deceit.

Ps 32:1-2 Blessed is the man who has no iniquity and whose spirit there is no deceit

Jer 17:9-10 God detests a deceitful heart. 

We have to tell what is wrong. But when we speak the truth, we need to have a sincere, humble and heart of love when we speak to others. We should not have the attitude of forcing others to listen.

-We should ask God to cleanse our heart to free our heart from deceit.

1 Pet 1:22 Important to purified our souls and love one another  earnestly. No backstabbing but with sincere love.
