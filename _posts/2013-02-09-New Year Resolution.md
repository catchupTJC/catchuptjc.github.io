-As Christians we should have clear goals in the Lord and ultimately our goal is to enter the heavenly kingdom.

-At the start of every new year, we should asked ourselves whether we are prepared to enter heaven.

-What kinds of goals should we have?

1) Establish a close relationship with God
Before we establish a relationship with God, do we also have a close relationship with others as well? With family, with friends, with others, with brethren etc?.
Rom 5:10 -11 While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by his death. We also should rejoice in God whom we have received reconciliation

-As Christians our relationship should be close to God as well as with family, friends, brethren and others.

-1 Jn 4:20 How you treat your brothers is how you treat God. 

-Mt 25: 34-40 When you do good to your brethren, you have done it on Jesus.

-How is your relationship with your family, with God? 

-Do we make time for our family, for God in divine service?

-If we want to build a beautiful relationship with our family and God, we will need to make this resolution. 
Is 30:15 We need to return and rest. Today we are too busy and do not have time to observe the Sabbath of rest and nurture the relationship with God and family. 

-This should be our life goal to build this close relationship with our own family and with God. 

-It is important to communicate with our own family when we have the opportunity.

James 4:8 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.

2nd Goal : Neh 8:1-3, 9-10 This was the 1st service after returning to Jerusalem. They were united and have gone through the process of rebuilding the temple. 

-Ezra was invited to read the book of law and everybody stood up when the book of law was opened. They all wept when they heard the word of God. The word of God was pricking their hearts to repentance. 

-Neh 8:10 The joy of the Lord is our strength. 

-Ps 16:9-11 Davidâ€™s heart is glad and his soul rejoices because he is not forsaken by God and is with God. 

-Today we rejoice is because we have Jesus. JC is our soul and life.  The source of our joy is from JC.

-Phil 3:1, 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always was encouraged by Paul when he was in prison. How did Paul do it? The joy came from God. 

In conclusion

Our new year goals are
1)	We should be diligent building a good relationship with our family and with God. 
2)	Secondly is to gain our joy from the Lord.
