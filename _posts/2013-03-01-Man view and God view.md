Is 55:8-9 For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways. For heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways, so my thoughts than your thoughts.

Mk 12: 41-44 The offering of the widow’s mite. In man’s view the offering of the widow is little but Jesus said that the poor widow has offered her life as she has offered all she had while the rich has offered out of their abundance.

-The best offering is not on the amount but how much of what we offered from our livelihood and life.  

-Did we offer our life to God measured by time? How much time have we used for God?

-1Kings 17:7-24 Elijah and the widow from Zarephath.  Elijah told the widow not to fear for thus said the Lord, “The jar of meal shall not be spent and the oil shall not run dry”. Such was the faith of Elijah. 

-The measure of flour vs the words of God, which comes first? The widow chose to follow the words of Elijah and believed in the words of God over the little flour she had. 

-God can see beyond what we human can see. 

If we can view like what God views then this is good.

Mal 3:8-10 What is the difference between tithes and abundance? Once is countable and the other uncountable. 

If we have the same view of God, then we can understand what God wants us to do. 

James 2: 1-6 Man judge the outward appearance while God does not. 

1 Sam 16:6-7 Whatever Samuel sees is different from what God sees. God see the heart over the appearance of man.

1 Sam 10:23-24 

Samuel was comparing Saul with the rest as Saul was a head taller than the rest.

-Similarly when God requested Samuel to anoint a new king, he thought that God chose Jesse because of his appearance. 

-God corrected Samuel and told him that God does not see how a man sees but looks at his heart.

-Similarly when Pharisees saw that Jesus was with the tax collectors, they viewed the tax collectors as sinners. However Jesus said that he came to save sinners and did not distant himself away from them.

-Luke 22:31-34 Jesus could see the weakness of Peter that he will deny Jesus 3x while the rest thought that he was full of faith.

-We need to self examine and evaluate our weaknesses and try to improve ourselves.  If we can self evaluate, we can keep ourselves watchful not to sin but to improve ourselves. 

-Paul was like this, to think himself weak and to keep himself watchful. 

- In church, we should look at our weakness and improve ourselves.
