-Holy communion is to remember Jesus Christ's death

-1 Cor 2:1-2 Paul in his message to the Corinthian members was that Jesus and the cross that Jesus was crucified

-Act 22:3, Act 5:33 Gamaliel was a respected teacher.

-Paul was a student of Gamaliel under strict discipline and was respected. But when he believed in Jesus, what he could declare is Jesus and the cross.
1 Cor 1:18 -19, 21 The word of the cross is folly for those perishing but for those being saved it is the power of God.

-when we pray, this is the time that God manifest his power 

-When we sing hymns, God will manifest his strength.Through all these methods to show his greatness and wisdom of God.

-We partake Holy Communion (HC) this is the source of strength for our spiritual life.

-Paul is willing to bear the cross

-Mt 16:24 If any man wants to become Jesus's disciples, they must first deny himself and take up his cross and follow Jesus.

-Col 1:24 Paul was willing to suffer for the sake of the church.

-Have we suffered for the church? God finds these sufferings precious in the eyes of God. (Eg working late/sacrifice holiday for church work).

-Jesus is no more in the flesh to suffer and this responsibility has been passed to us to suffer for the church, to preach, to participate in divine work.

-Jesus suffer for us, we must suffer for Christ.

-Phil 1:27-30 Conduct your life worthy of Jesus. To suffer willingly for Jesus. -Paul was willing to spread the word of the cross, to bear the cross and to suffer for Jesus. This is something we have to follow.

-Gal 6:14 For Paul the riches of the world is of no value. But whatever Jesus did, he saw it as precious.  

-What is our value to the world? What is the world’s value to you?

-Without me, can the world still exists? If you feel that you are very valuable to the world you cannot let go and priority to do God’s work comes last.

-We need to choose wisely and not be at the crossroad to choose the world and forsake Jesus. 

HOLY COMMUNION (HC) 
1 Cor 11:23-30 

-HC is one of the sacrament in our church. 

-Why is the Holy Communion important ? 

-When we take the unleaven bread and the fruit of the vine, it has been spiritualized to the body and blood of Jesus.

-HC promise to give us life, to give us strength

-To give us spiritual communion in life

What kind of attitude should we have to take HC?
1)	Prepare ourselves. Do not take lightly the HC as this is a sacrament spiritualized to the flesh and blood of Jesus after blessing to help us in our spiritual life.
2)	Calm yourself and think of the sacrifices of Jesus, his love for us. What have we glorified Jesus in our life? If we partake Holy Communion in a proper manner, then it will provide us spiritual communion and strength.
3)	Self examine what sins committed, where we have fall short  and resolve for God to be a better Christian.
