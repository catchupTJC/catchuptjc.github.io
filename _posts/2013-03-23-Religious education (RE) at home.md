-The children in one of our TJC will come to church and once they arrive in church, they will first kneel down and pray. In the house, they have daily prayers together as a family and have daily bible reading together. 

-This habit is passed down from the younger generations. To come to church and pray, during service to write sermon notes, daily reading bible and prayers which will start at home. All children will go for RE classes.  

-Today the challenge is children only read the bible only during RE classes but at home they don’t read the bible at all. The church is like tuition center just to gather bible knowledge. However to have bible knowledge is insufficient but more importantly to live and practice the word of God.

- As Christian family, we must have a family altar at home.

Ps 127:3-4 “ Behold children are a heritage from the lord, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one’s youth” 

-The arrow in the hand of a warrior depicts the relationship of how important is parents’ guidance. The more guidance is put into nurturing the children, the better the results just like how archer shoots the arrow with strength.

- Parents must know the aim and goal to have the right direction in nurturing the children’s faith. 

-If the child is guided in the lord, he will be righteous and will conduct himself correctly in the Lord.

-The RE at home is very importantly . It will allow our child to be righteous  in the Lord and are able to resist temptation in the world.

Deut 6:4-9 God asked Moses to tell the Israelites to teach their children 

Ex 2:5-10  Moses when he was young, he was taught by his own mother which cannot be compared to the palace education he received.

Heb 11:23-26 Moses mom taught him about God, his responsibility towards God and who is he. 

Only through this RE from the mom he is able to grow in faith.  His foundation is RE, in God first and supplemented by knowledge of the world. 

-We should teach our children what are our responsibility towards God, towards people, to live a life as a good Christian in our daily lives.

-RE at home is to teach them how to live a life as a good Christian 

-1 Sam 1:1 , 21-22 When Samuel was young, he was taught by his mother as he will only be sent when he has been weaned. 

-At what age was he weaned? Some said it is 12 years old as at this age, only then he is able to serve God. It is unlikely at the age of 3 or 4 as he  cannot serve the Lord and serve Eli the priest.

-So during this age at 12 and younger, the RE was given by the mother on why he needs to serve the Lord, his purpose and responsibilities.

1 Sam 2:26  the child Samuel grew in stature and in favour both with God and man. Was it because of Eli? No as his 2 sons did evil in the sight of God. 

1 Sam 3:1 Samuel foundation in God came from his mother.  If RE is not done properly this will affect the children. 

-The church cannot be solely responsible in the children’s faith  as there are limitation. The religious education (RE) should be grounded at home.

-Eg how to practice love? Love is to help others and practice it. Love is patient and is taught at home. So RE at home is not bible knowledge but more importantly to teach them how to live a life of a God fearing child. 

If we have strong RE at home, this will enable the children’s future and foundation to be strong in the Lord.
