In our life there are times when we face a lot of problems and we struggle to find solutions to overcome the problems which seems to have no end. But it is at this time, we should learn to be still.

-Ex 14:10 
The Israelites were afraid and they wanted to find solutions and cried to the Lord. But what did Moses said to them?

-Ex 14:13-14 
Moses wanted them not to do anything at all and see the salvation of the lord. At this time God wanted them to be still and entrust everything to God.

-Ps 62:1-2 
David knew that the salvation comes from God. God is my rock and my salvation. 

-Ps 62:5 
David reminded himself to entrust in the Lord. 

-2 Chr 20:1-4 
The people & King Jehoshaphat feared and he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah and sought God. 

-2 Chr 20:14-17 
God acted and told the people  “Fear not and be not dismayed for the battle is not yours but God’s…” God asked them not to do anything, just stand still and see how God is going to save you.

-A man needs to stand still and let God act. -To wait quietly for God to act.

-Ps 39:1-3 I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue, I will bridle my mouth..” 
Although he is angry, he will not say anything in the presence of his enemies. Emotionally he is angry and yet he held his tongue and kept silent.

-Sometimes some people may say something bad about you and in this instance, we have to learn to hold our tongue and keep our silence.

-Mt 27:12-14 Jesus kept his silence in the midst of many accusations thrown against him. This is a very tough action to learn but it is something we must strive for. 

-Jesus Christ was suffering so much from false accusations and yet, he could pray to the Father in heaven to forgive them. 

-In our times of false accusations, just remember that God alone knows and that is sufficient.  Wait and be still and see how God will act. -There are something that you find that things are not right or there are false accusations, we must remember that God knows and that is sufficient. 
Eg in the church building it is important to understand that this is God’s house and we should work towards in fulfilling God’s will.

-1Chr 17:1,4 David had intention to build the temple for God. However God instructed Nathan to inform David that he will not be the one to build the temple for God. The reason given by David is “There is much blood in my hands” could mean he has killed many people during war or that the country is still at war 

-1 Chr 19, 20 All through David’s life, he is still at war and it is not the right time for David to build the temple. 
1 Kings 4:25,1 Kings 5:2-5 King Solomon was able to build the temple of God as there was peace in the country. 

-1 Kings 6:7 The whole temple was erected without any sound. The temple was erected quietly. The work done outside may not be quiet eg chipping the stone

-Similarly we can try to discuss any forms of plans or any issues, differences. After the discussion, we are able to have a good and acceptable work.  However the most important is at the end of it when we bring it to the temple, we have to be quiet. This is what God has planned and ask God to be with us. To learn the works of God and be still.
