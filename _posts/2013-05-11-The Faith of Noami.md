-Ruth 1:1-2 The family shifted to Moab from Bethlehem due to famine. Bethlehem is the land of promise from God to the Israelites. The fact that they shifted from the promise land of God, Bethlehem to Moab has to do with their faith. When they shifted to Moab, situation grew worse.

-Ruth 1:3-4 Noami’s  husband, Elimelech died in the land of Gentiles. The 2 sons married Moabite wives. They lived there for 10 years even though there was no more famine in Bethlehem. Even the 2 sons later died and did not leave behind any children.

-Ruth 1:6 Noami heard that God has visited his people and there was food there. So she desired to return back to Bethlehem.

-Lesson learnt is when she met with trouble in Bethlehem(famine) she left the place and went to Moab. Similarly when we are Christians in TJC, we may leave our faith when met with calamities/troubles. These trials may be test from God.

-Gen 26:1-3 When there was a famine, Abraham made the decision to move to Egypt which almost resulted him to lose his wife if not for the intervention from God. Here the famine happened again and Isaac wanted to move to Egypt. 

-This time God appeared to Isaac and instructed him not to move and promised him blessings and that God will be with him. God’s presence is even better than using their own methods to resolve.

-When we face some calamities, we should not just leave God as this may be trials and test from God.
1st Test from Noami is that when she met with trouble, she just left her faith and the promised land. This resulted even worse fate for her family.
2nd Test – In the times of peace during the 10 years, she has forgotten about God and even her 2 sons married Moabites wives as the place was comfortable. This is something we have to be careful in our life of faith when we are at peace. Eg if in our church we have peace, our faith is stagnant as we do not pursue to grow. Sometimes when an incident happened eg earthquake this will awaken members faith to grow.  

-2 Sam 11:2 David slept very late and woke up as the sun was setting and he saw something that he should not see. It was peaceful and he was not vigilant. He then committed sexual immorality and killed her husband. 

-1 Kings 10:14,26 King Solomon was very rich & strong army. 
1Kings 11 During the time when there is peace and wealth, King Solomon started to deteriorate in his faith and began to sin.

-Actually at the time when there is peace, it is important to train ourselves similar to soldiers. Eg in Theolo, preparing the students with strict discipline to train them in spiritual faith, in prayers, in reading the bible so that they can prepare themselves in the world. -We have to be watchful and be vigilant at the time when we have peace. 

-Deut 8:10-14 This is Moses warning to the Israelites not to forget God especially when they have abundant food and peace.

3rd Point 
–Noami was reminded of God when she heard that God visited the land of Bethlehem and returned to the promise land of God. At the time when there was trouble, at least Noami remembered to turn to God.

-Judges 3:7-9, 11, 12-15, 30-31 This is the pattern and is the problem of man. Sin, cried to God, God delivers them and the cycle continues. This really proves that God is truly merciful God.

-Ps 107:1, 6, 13,19,28 Here tells us the love of God is eternal. As long as the Israelites call to the Lord, God will deliver them. Similarly we are liken to Israelites, we have our weaknesses, and when we face test/trials, we will cry to the lord and return to God and God will deliver us. God loves all his children no matter how they sin.

-This opportunity and forgiveness from God will not be eternal. So when there is mercy it is important that we know how to return to God and receive God’s blessings.

- Are we not like Noami? Do we leave God when we face troubles, at when at peace we forget God and when we face troubles again we return to God.

- So it is important that we should not have this kind of faith like Noami. We must perfect our faith that is towards God and strong. Forever rooted in God no matter in times of troubles or even at peace our faith and love in God growing stronger each day.
