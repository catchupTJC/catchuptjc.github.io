Luke 15:11-12 Parable of the prodigal son. The younger son  asked his father to give his share of property. The share of the property prepared by his father is based on the love for his son. 

-Does the son deserve this since he did not need to labour for this share of property? To the younger son he deserved it and sold off the property to get the money for his enjoyment. 

-Ecc 2:10-11 King Solomon enjoyed the pleasures that he had labored. Yet, he found it all is vainity.

-Luke 12:16-18, 20 Parable of the rich fool. 

-He accumulated his riches so that he can enjoy all his labour. In the end, God called him, “Fool” For that night God required his soul. This prodigal son took his inheritance and squandered all his money for his enjoyment. 

-Today when we do more divine work,  should we get more blessings? 

Mt 20:1-16 Parable of the workers and the vineyard. The workers grumbled as they toiled the whole day while the workers worked for 1 hour had the same wage of 1 denarii.

-The landowner told them that he did no wrong to them as the wages promised is the same.

-Similarly when we do divine work, the reward is the same for those who worked their life time compared to those who worked for a short time. The expectations from man differs from God on what the blessings or reward should be given.

-Mt 7:21-23 Lord did I not do mighty works in your name and yet God said I do not know you. Why? For God says that he who does the will of God will be saved. 

-The prodigal son only remembered his father when he squandered all his money. Luke 15:14 A famine arose and at the point when he was so hungry, he returned to his father and his turning point was when he said that he is not worthy to be his father’s son. He realized all his wrongs done towards his father.

-Gen 32:9-10 Jacob felt that he is not worthy to own all his possessions and wealth. He knows all his wealth comes from God as he first left his hometown, all he carried was his staff.

-2 Sam 7:18-20 King David received blessings & wealth from God. Yet he said that he is not worthy to deserve it. 

-How is it that these examples felt that they did not deserve these blessings? This is because they only saw God and felt unworthy to receive these blessings. When we feel that we are not worthy, this is the time that God will pour blessings.

-1 Cor 15:9-10 Paul said that he is the least of the apostle as he persecuted the disciples of Jesus. Yet when he felt he is unworthy, this is the time he worked harder than the rest. 

-If we have the attitude that we are unworthy and are not proud, this is pleasing to God. In our faith, we must have the attitude that we are not worthy then only we can see JC and see our contributions are nothing. Whatever we serve is our responsibility towards God.

Luke 17:7-10 After the servant has done what he should do, he will not be thanked by the master as this is his responsibility. We are unworthy servants as we have only done what was our duty.

-Similarly when we do church work, do not expect others to praise or thank you as this is our responsibility. Do not have the expectations to get others to thank you, to support you, to praise you but this is our responsibility. Even those who have criticized or hurt you it does not matter. 

-The important thing to understand is that we have the attitude that we are unworthy servants when we serve God. No matter what happens, we must always maintain this unworthy attitude in service knowing that this is our responsibility towards  God expecting nothing.
