-It is a normal process for those believing in Jesus Christ to continue to improve in their behaviour. This improvement is important and is part of our Christian growth

-Eph 4:11-13 In order to build a glorious church, God will give various gifts to different members and pool their talents to build the body of Christ. How? Based on the truth and words of God as a foundation. 

-When everybody has a common understanding based on the words of God, there is then maturity.

-Heb 5:12-14 Those immature believers are unskilled in the words of righteousness. This refers to those who do not know what should be done that is pleasing to God.

-As Christian we should know how to behave and have the correct attitude in the house of God and as a Christian.

-Knowing and cannot put into practice reflect that we are still not mature in the word of God. Then we are likened like babes still drinking milk. We should be mature trained by practice to strive for perfection as mentioned in Heb 6:1

-1 Cor 3: 1-3 There is still strife & jealousy and Paul reckon them as babes in Christ as they behave like people of the world and of the flesh.

-A believer who is truly spiritual is a  person who manifests the life of Christ such as love, joy, kindness, peace, gentleness etc. 

-A mature and spiritual Christian must have the behaviour of JC in terms of words and deeds and not like the people of the world. 

-Gal 5:24 Those who belong in JC have crucified the flesh with its passions & desires. We should examine ourselves whether we really reflect the conduct of JC. People of the world pursue different things eg their celebrity idols, worldly status, wealth etc. 

-Immature Christian is also a Christian who is without knowledge.

Rom 10:2 They only have zeal but do not have the interest in the words of God & is not enlightened. Eg a believer may be actively serving God but lacks the truth and knowledge

Eph 4:17-18 They are ignorant in the teachings of God and do what they like. But those who truly know the word of God will know how to behave in the Lord.

-Eg Youths know how to marry in the Lord, how to be chaste,  how to conduct themselves. They have good understanding in the word of God. This means that our youths are growing in the word of God and growing in maturity.

-Acts 8:1,4,7 Although during the time of persecution and the members were scattered, yet they know how to preach the word of God. These are mature and independent believers and they know what they need to do, to evangelize despite of persecutions. 

-Today we should not wait but to continue to preach and bring our friends to JC. This shows maturity

- Mature Christian should also be able to discern good and bad and use their own body to glorify God through their conduct

-Mt 5:16 “so that they may see your good works to glorify God.” This is a mature Christian. 

-Today we have to be a mature Christian and to change pursuing perfection. A mature Christian should be able to shine for God.

-A mature Christian must have the correct perception of truth and must distinguish the perception of the world where Paul deems the world as refuse/rubbish and only JC is of value.

-Mature Christian must be able to go through all kinds of trials. Prov 17:3. A truly mature Christian is able to face all kinds of trials and tests by God and their faith is refined. So mature Christian knows how to face trials and how to 
overcome their weaknesses.

-Isaiah 30:20-21 This is a great comfort knowing that no matter what hardships, sufferings, we will see our Teacher who will not hide from us. We will know who we should rely on and to submit to. We will be able to hear from God himself who is our teacher who will lead us to the right path.
