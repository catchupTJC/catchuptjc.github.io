-There are 2 incidents whereby Moses strucked the rock.

1st time is recorded in Ex 17:1-7 Here God instructed how Moses should go about it and Moses followed closely according to the instruction of the Lord. 

-Num 33:1-2,12-14. In Rephidim there was no water. When Moses struck the rock, water came out from the rock and there was water to drink.

2nd incident – Numbers 20: 1 They also came to the wilderness of Zin and this time in Kadesh they had not water to drink. At the time Mariam died there. 

-Num 20:7-8 The Lord instructed Moses to take the rod and assemble the congregation, together with Aaron, Moses is suppose to tell the rock to yield water. 

-The difference between the 2nd time and 1st time, is that God instructed Moses to struck the rock but the 2nd time God instructed Moses to tell the rock to yield water. 

-	Num 20:9-11 God only instructed Moses to tell the rock to yield water but here Moses strucked the rock twice although water still came out from the rock.

-	Methods may differ although they bring the same result. God still allowed water yield from the rock although Moses did not followed the instruction of God where he strucked twice the rock. However the consequences was different based on Moses’ actions.

-	Num 30:12 God said to Moses and Aaron “Because you did not believe in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore Moses was not allowed to bring the assembly into the land which God has given them.”

-	It is important to have faith with the correct actions. 

-	Without faith you cannot be justified and you cannot please God.

-Rom 3: 21-23 The righteousness of God can only be justified by faith.

-Gal 3:2 Did you receive the Spirit by works or by hearing with faith? Some of those who have the holy spirit still have bad conduct. So those who receive the holy spirit is it because of their works or by faith? 

-In the book of Hebrews Without faith it is impossible to please God. In book of James states faith without works is dead. 

-If we have faith alone and not works, then our faith is dead.

-Moses did not act according to the commandment of God, God said that Moses did not have faith in him. This is because their action did not profess their faith.

-God expects that if you say that you have total faith in God, you have to obey and do the commandment and instruction of God. It is not enough to say you have faith or works but yet do not follow the instruction of God.

-Numb 20:12 Not only God informed Moses and Aaron that they did not have faith in him but God also said that they did not honour God before the assembly. To God this is very serious

-Ps 106:32-33 The assembly angered Moses and made his spirit bitter and he spoke words that were rash.  Num 20:10 “ Hear now you rebels shall we bring forth water for you out or this rock.” It was as if  Moses and Aaron is the one who will bear forth the water and not God.  

-Why Moses considered as the meekest man spoke rash words? He was angry with the assembly. 

-Proverbs 14:29, 19:11 He who is slow to anger are those who are wise. When one is angry, he loses his logical mind and he loses control over his emotions.

-When the people irritated Moses, he lost control. Today as Christians, we ought to be patient, people with wisdom, slow to anger. 

-James 1:19 “Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.” Sometimes you think you are right and you are angry but unfortunately even when you are right, you are not able to edify others. It is important not to let our emotions control us.  

-When we are angry, we ignore the commandments of God.

-Moses was angry and he did something wrong against God’s commandments. 

-Although we think it is a small matter as Moses only struck twice the rock instead of telling the rock to yield water, to God it is a serious matter as he did not honour God before the assembly and disobeyed God’s commandments.

-Lev 10:1-3 Then Moses said to Aaron, ‘This is what the Lord has said, “I will show myself holy among those who are near me and before all the people I will be glorified”

-When Nadab and Abihu offered unholy fire, God struck them dead. Although it is just fire, God’s requirement must be met.

-If we honour and put God first, we must follow exactly the method set by God. If you follow your own method, you are not honouring God.

-Today when we do divine work, there are many methods of doing God’s work. In the bible there are certain methods that we need to follow to achieve the results. This is to ensure that we set God holy and honourable before men and ourselves. 

Conclusion
-A reminder for us. We may have many ways to do divine work and the principle is whatever methods we adopt, it does not go against the principles of the bible. Do not see just the results but methods of going about it is very important to ensure we honour God before men.
