-2 Tim 2: 20-21 We are all God’s noble vessels. Prophet Habakkuk did not understand why God would use the hostile enemies to punish the Israelites. So vessels does not only reflect the people of God but can also be enemies of God to be used according to God’s purpose.

- Vessels can be made by different materials such as gold, silver, wood and earthenware. Those who are made of inferior materials would be used for menial work eg garbage can.

-2 Tim 2: 21. Here If anyone purifies himself then the vessel can be for noble use and useful to the master ready for any good work.

-1 Cor 1:26-30 In the Corinth church the members were gifted and they were very proud. Here Paul tells them that God chose the foolish in the world to shame the wise and the weak to shame the strong. God chose what is lowly , despised in the world. 

-When Jesus Christ (JC) came into the world his disciples are fishermen, tax collectors, ordinary people.

-Act 4:13 The Sanhedrin were amazed on the boldness of Peter and John as they were perceived as uneducated and common men. 

-A blind member wanted to serve to play piano and through the power of God he was able to play all the hymns. A sister also had the zeal to interpret and prayed to God for help and she could do it well. When she thought that it was her ability to do it, she was not able to interpret. This taught her the lesson that her ability to interpret well was from God and not through her own effort. 

-If you are willing to serve God ask God to help you. God does not choose the wise and those with ability but as long as you have the zeal, ability can come from God.

-As long as you have the heart, you can be made as a vessel for God to use.

-2 Tim 2:21 To be a noble use of God, the person must purify himself. 

-1 Thes 4:3-5 The will of God is that he would want us to be purified and sanctified. A person who is not clean, how can you be of noble use by God?

-We cannot be like the people of the world. For those who serve the Lord must be holy and sanctified just like animal sacrificed cannot have blemish when offered to God. The priests will check to ensure there is no blemish.

-So when serving the Lord no matter what tasks eg REU teacher, speaker, hymnal, interpreter etc, it is important the conduct is holy and not merely based on ability. If we feel that we fall short in this requirement or have weaknesses, we must repent and change.

-A noble vessel are also suitable for use. Sometimes we are not used because the time is not right eg Moses

-Act 7:20 -30 In the early years of Moses he was equipped with the knowledge of the Egyptians and at the same time he was also founded by the teachings of God through his  mother. He took revenge for an Israelite and later ran away. After 40 years when he was a shepherd for many years when he felt that he is not ready or incapable, God called him out.

-In church, some youths may be ready to serve and some may not be ready. When they have changed, God will then use them.

Eg David was a young youth that was ready to be made use by God.

-Act 26:9-18 God has a purpose for Paul. God made him the apostle of the Gentiles.

-What is the purpose that God has for us? Have we ever asked ourselves this? Today we may lack the zeal and commitment for God. Do we really pray to God to know his purpose and will for us?
Do our prayers reflect our desire to serve God according to his purpose?

-Paul told Timothy that he has a choice. If he wants to serve God, it is not because he is of ability but because he needs to be purified so that God can use him anytime ready for good work.
Similarly, ability comes from God. All we need is to purify ourselves, equip ourselves to be God’s vessel of noble use to be ready anytime for his good work in terms of evangelism, pastoral, religious education etc.
