-To stop bad habits such as smoking is a gradual process. 

-Similarly Christian need to transform in Christ and this is also a gradual process

-Why do we need to transform? As Christian we need to transform in Christ and we must be holy and perfect just like Jesus.

-New believers or those who just received the holy spirit will in the beginning be very diligent in prayers, service but the zeal can gradually fade away.

-Transformation in Christ is not easy but sometimes the words of Christ can make us change.

-1 Cor 15:20 The resurrection of Jesus is the beginning of first fruit of those who have fallen asleep. Jesus will be an example to follow.

-We no longer live for ourselves but for Christ that we may resurrect together with Jesus Christ (JC)

-Eph 2:4-6 when we are baptized, our sins are buried and cleanse. When we rise up from the water, we resurrect with JC. We are saved by the grace of JC . Being born again, we should begin to transform to be better in Jesus Christ.

-We can only change if we depend on Jesus Christ and not by our own self.

-Jn15:5 -He who abides in me and I in him will bear fruit as Jesus is the vine and we are the branches. If we want to be perfect in Jesus, we need to depend and rely on Jesus to help us to transform.

-Today according to the word of God, they change without hope, joy they are now joyful and with hope. The word of God helps them to transform.

-Jn 15:2-3  Jesus said that the disciples are clean by the word of God. We can be clean as the word of God provides us a standard to transform.

-1 Pet 1:22 Through obeying the truth, we can be purified.

-Today when we say standards, it must be according to the requirement and word of God.

-We are unable to submit the word of God and therefore cannot be totally transformed in Christ

-Acts 8:9-23 why is Simon still bond in sin even though he has baptized. This is because he is still bound by old habits, old beliefs and therefore he cannot change his conduct and could not transform in Christ.

-A person who is truly changed and transform is able to put away his old sinful self but is a new man full of virtue and is perfect

-Today if we want to change we need to put a lot of effort

-1 Cor 15:9-10 Paul regarded himself the least of the apostles

-Act 22:3-4, 26:9-10  In the life of Paul, from a persecutor he later became the one who preached for Christ. In the beginning no one dare to receive Paul. 

-Act 9:23 Paul later was sent back to his hometown Tarsus. Only after a decade, he appeared in ministry when Barnabus brought him out.

-Paul took years to transform in Christ and he was already a mature Christian when Barnabus took him out.

-We are changed at the point when we are baptized but then it is during the time after baptism we need to transform ourselves gradually. Through the word of God reminding you to change your weaknesses. 

-Through reading the bible and listening sermons, more longer prayers and spiritual nurture can we then truly transform ourselves in Christ.
