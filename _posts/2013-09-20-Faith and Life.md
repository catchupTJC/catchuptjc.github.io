A brother from Gombak got a get well card from Gombak Youth to Sis Themaah who was sick. He felt good that he was able to show love and care by doing this divine work. 

-In our daily lives are we able to combine faith in our lives? In our daily lives, it is difficult to manifest the teachings of Jesus. It is difficult to manifest our faith in our lives.

-For example to love our enemies. Is it easy to do this? If we are willing to comply to the teachings of the bible, then we must do this. Eg to seek his kingdom and his righteousness and to put 
aside everything. Can we do this? Eg to forgive 70x7 times is it possible?

-Sometimes we only obey selectively. We only obey the commandments of God only when it is suitable to us. 

-However in actual fact, God requires us to obey 100% of all his commandments and not selectively. That is God’s standard which we must follow.

-Why is it difficult for us to obey 100% of God’s commandments?

1) Faith

Abraham gave up everything based on the promise of God. 

Gen 12:4 – At the age of 75 years old he was called out by God to go somewhere he did not know. With faith, he just followed God’s instruction. 

-Gen 12: 10 When there was famine, Abraham went down to Egypt. Gen 26 In the same situation when there was a famine, the son of Abraham, Isaac was instructed by God not to depart to go to Egypt. Isaac was full of faith and followed God’s instruction.

-A lot of people were not able to obey God’s commandments because of their daily problems or sometimes it is the influence of other people.

-Gal 2: 11-14 Paul rebuked Peter because Peter was influenced by the Jews and quickly separated himself from the gentiles when he saw the Jews coming. 

-We sometimes will be influenced by the people around us and because of  pressure we compromised our faith. Eg drinking liquor with friends.

-The environment will pressure us to conform to the world. Despite of this pressure, can we live by our faith and overcome this? Do we find the teaching of Jesus too difficult to comply?

-Jn 6:60 “This is a hard saying, who can understand it?” 

TJC is known to be conservative in the teachings of God compared to the other churches. 

-Why? This is because we want to be completely conform to the teachings of God even though it is difficult to keep it eg baptism in river or sea even during winter.

-In TJC we are not able to commit adultery, cannot eat blood, cannot pray to idols and as such these teachings deem hard to merge with our faith. 

2) Laziness

-We read the bible eg preach the gospel to all nations. If we do not do it, then it becomes theory and in vain.

- If we were to put our faith together we need to have 100% complete faith and obedience in God’s commandments.

-Rom 4:18-21 This is the faith of Abraham. If we want to have faith in our daily lives, we must have a complete faith and trust in the commandment of God. 

-If we say we have faith in God, we just be submissive and be completely obedient to the commandments of God. We just do it with total submissiveness.

-James 1:25 Today we know the teachings of God. We just need to do it as you know the word of God is true and is beneficial for all of us. We just follow and do it despite of the pressure of the world to conform. 

-Gal 1: 10 “Do I please man? If I please man, I should not be the servant of Christ.

-It is important that we should have our stand and principle. Our principle is to totally follow Jesus commandments. We do not compromise and change what we believe in. This is something that God requires of us.

-We need to be steadfast in God’s laws & truth despite daily outside pressures. Persist in the truth and keep our faith.

-Eg to keep Sabbath is from Fri evening to Saturday evening. We need to keep every Sabbath service even Sabbath morning. Can we be steadfast and resolute to keep the Sabbath day?

3) Holy Spirit

From the help of the Holy spirit, God can help us to be a complete Christian. The holy spirit will move us and guide us in our daily lives to help us to walk in faith, to be steadfast in his teachings and to serve him. Even for those who are without the holy spirit, the holy spirit will move us and by the guidance of the word of God will guide us in our path to walk with faith.
