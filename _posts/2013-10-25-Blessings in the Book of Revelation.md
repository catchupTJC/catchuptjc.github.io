-1st blessing – Rev 1:1-3

-The beginning the book of Revelation is not about calamities. It is a revelation of Jesus Christ to show his servants and starts with blessings. 

-Rev 1:3 blessed is those who reads the words of the prophesy 
and blessed are those who hear and keep what is written.

-So the beginning of the book of Rev is a book of blessings for those who hear and keep it.

-Is 6:9-10  There are many who are reading the bible or hearing sermons and yet without understanding. We all know the standards of God and yet do not follow. 

-For those who have the fear of God, they will always ponder and reflect to make sure that they keep the commands or the will of God 

-Not everyone can understand or accept the gospel or commands of God. 

-Book of revelation (Rev) was initially sealed. However it was slowly opened to reveal to us by God.

-Dan 12:8-9 At the time of Daniel, all the prophesies were sealed until the time of the end it will be revealed.

-The basic doctrines such as baptism, holy communion were never practiced and yet how were the early workers know the path of salvation? It was the holy spirit that revealed when the time was right. 

-The first time, truth was revealed to the apostles but later on the truth was distorted over time.

-Some can understand and accept the truth easily but some are unable to.

-Rev 1:3 As members In the true church, there is understanding of the truth and can accept it however do not practice and actually doing it.

-Rev 2:7 He who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says. To him who conquers they will eat the tree of life. When are you successful in conquering?

-You are successful when you know and understand the truth and do it. Then blessings will pour.

-People today are sensitive, not able to accept criticism or anything disagreeable and they easily get angry. As such it is important to be practicing Christians.

-2nd blessings –Rev 14:13 Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord

-What is  death that is valuable? If we die in our own sin, our riches,  there is no value in our death. A death that is valuable is to keep our faith until the end. 

-Luke 12:13-21 The parable of the rich fool. This parable is to remind ourselves that at the end of our lives it is important to hold on to our faith as riches cannot follow us when we die. 

-Today we must seize any opportunity to serve God as anytime God will take our lives and we do not want to be like the rich fool.

-Rom 2:6-8  Are we the one who is willing to give up our faith for glory and honour? Or are we those who serve God faithfully as God will render to every man accoding to his works. 

-Every work we do for God is remembered by God and will grant us blessings for what works we have done.

-Who are those who die in the Lord? Those who practice the word of God and those who sacrifice and serve the lord will die in the Lord. 

-Blessings of the end day is the blessings we can obtained based on the works we do. God judge a person by the works that he has done. As such let us be vigilant to always hold fast to our faith right to the end.
