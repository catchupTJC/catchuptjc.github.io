-Mt 11:28-30 Come to me all who labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

-His yoke is easy as his truth is easy to practice. The teachings of Jesus is to be submissive to the truth of God, to manifest love and to emphasize what is in the heart rather than outward manifestations. 

What can we learn from Jesus?
1) Learn to follow the will of the Father

-Jn 6:38-40 “I come down from heaven to do the will of the Father who sent him”.  Jesus manifest his submissiveness and is the responsibility that he is willing to take up.

-What is the will of the Father? Jn 6:39-40 These are the things that Jesus needs to do when he is in the world and he understood the will of the Heavenly Father.

-He came in the flesh and as in the flesh he has his own will and decision. Just like Adam and Eve, they were given instruction that they were not to partake the fruit of good and evil. The will of God was good however they still disobeyed.

-Problem is that man would rather follow the will of man rather than the will of God.

-Generally we as Christian know the will of God.

-Jonah 1: 1-3 The word of Lord came to Jonah to arise and go to Nineveh in the east. However Jonah to flee to Tarshish to the west. 

-Why? He did not want to follow the instruction of God as he did not want to preach to the people of Nineveh as he did not want the wicked citizens of Nineveh to be saved. However God wanted them to have the opportunity to repent and be saved.

-Jonah did something foolish as he wanted to hide from the Lord. However he later repented.

-Men knows the will of God. Even more as True Jesus Church member we know that there are more regulations so that we can meet the high standards of God which is according to the will of God.

-Mt 7:21 Jesus clearly states that those who does the will of the Father will enter the kingdom of Heaven.

-As such we as Christians we must do the will of God and to do this is not easy. There may be struggle at times to follow the will of God.

-Luke 22:42 “Father if it is your will remove this cup from me but not my will but your will”  

-During this time, Jesus was in a struggle. He knows the will of God and at this time he also has his own will. In the end, God’s will take priority than his own will.

2) Learn to Rely on God
Jn 5:19 “Truly truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord but only what he sees the Father doing for whatever he does that the Son does likewise”.

-Jn 8:28 

-From these 2 passages, what Jesus wanted to tell us is whatever he does it comes from the strength of God. That is whatever he does he will rely on God. 

-When we do church work, do we rely on God or rely on man?

-Jer 17:5-8 Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his arm whose heart turns away from the Lord and blessed is the man who trust in the lord. Here shows the difference and consequences of trusting man and trusting God.

-Jesus did a lot of miracles. This ability came from God and not from man. 

-Sometimes we think we can solely depend on ourselves and unknowingly we drift further from God.

-Phil 4:13 “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”

-Through the strength of Jesus that the church work can be done well eg evangelistic, church building fund. We need to rely on God to do divine work. 

-How do we rely on God? It is through prayers. Prayers are important and is a basis and foundation to do church work. Eg prayers for REU, evangelistic, spiritual meeting. 

-The habit of prayer is important and must be in REU teachers, CMC members, leaders, members etc.

-Jn 12:49 Jesus will only speak the words that God wants him to speak. 

3) Learn to speak according to God’s will

-Jn 7:18 Jesus only speaks according to what God wants him to speak and the glory will be given to God. 

-When a person speaks in his own will the glory will come to his ownself.

-1 Cor 2: 1 Paul is highly educated. When he went to Corinth church and he did not use excellence of speech and he only spoke being Jesus Christ being crucified.

-Today, do we speak about Jesus? Do we spread Jesus’ salvation & gospel to attract more truth seekers to the church?

-In preaching the word of God, do we present the word of God or rather use the “methodology” or “attractions in audio/visual”?  

-Are the truth seekers attracted to the word of God or the skills & methodology of presentation? 

-Have we been attracted by the word of God? Have we ever been drawn by the bible? 

-Or are we being attracted by the “way” the person speaks rather than the word of God?  If we are, unknowingly we may lose our focus and importance of the word of God.

-What exactly attracts me? Is it the word of God.

-Jesus came to the world and he only spoke what God wants him to speak. 

-It is difficult for the people to accept eg when he told them to eat his flesh and drink his blood. It is easy for Jesus to just preach what the people wants to hear but that is not the will of God. Jesus followed the will of the Father and speak according to the word of God.

Summary
-We need to follow the likeness of Jesus. We need to learn to do the will of God, to learn to rely on God and to learn to speak what God wants to speak. In this manner then we can enter the rest that Jesus has promised us.
