-If tomorrow if Jesus were to judge us individually are we able to give a good results based on our performance based on the tests that Jesus has given.

-Jesus gives us trials to allow us to improve ourselves spiritually.

-Ps 66:10-12  The psalmist describes the tests of God. Whether we refine silver or gold, we need to refine with fire (tests/trials).

-If we ponder our spiritual life, we will realize that there are many shortcomings. 

-For year 2013, there may be facing a lot of trials and difficult situations. Some are afflicted with sickness. Some faced temptations, problems at work. 

-Why does God tests us? 

-Ps 66:12 The conclusion of trials is that it will bring us rich fulfillment. 

-God tests us different areas in terms of faith, love, our faithfulness towards God, our patience. 

1) God tests our faith.

-1 Pet 1: 6- Peter encouraged the church members as at that time they faced great trials. Peter asked them to rejoice greatly as they are facing trials and their faith are now being tested. 

-At the time of sickness, this is the time where our trials begins. In life there are times when we have overcome a certain obstacle and a more serious obstacle will come.

-We are then tested in our belief and faith in Jesus Christ.

-At this lowest time, it is more important that we need to rely more on our Jesus Christ.

-1 Pet 1: 7 When the fire comes towards us, whether we can face it we can see at this point. If we are victorious, we will be able to find grace, honour and glory. 

-Faith is not just taking attendance in church or faith is not gauged by our work in church or the time we spent in prayers and reading the bible. 

-Many may think they have great faith but at the time of testing , they are not able to be victorious. Faith can only be tested when we are able to be victorious of all trials. 

-Faith is tested by fire. Some faith are not tested by sickness, but also by anger, hurt. 

-There are many spiritual weaknesses and problems in different churches. 

-When you observe this, will you be discouraged in your faith? Will your faith be tested by the weaknesses of the church members?

-We must remember this. Jesus came to save sinners. If you admit of your sin and weaknesses that is why we congregate here to get help from Jesus. 

-We need to come together as a church to help in the spiritual weaknesses of the members.

2) Jesus Tests our Love

-2 Cor 8:1-5 Paul is telling the church in Corinth to look at the church of Macedonia. In great trials and affliction in the church of Macedonia they can still  rejoice . In their deep poverty, they still abounded in riches of liberty.  

-2 Cor 8:8 What is love? Some will only be able to display love only when they have excesses. Love means sacrifice. 

-If I have time I have love if I have no time, I cannot care for others. At this time when I am busy I cannot show my love. Some can give love to only specific groups who are good to us.

-Jesus love is without conditions. Jesus love is manifested on the cross in the book of Romans. 

-While we were sinners God died for us. This is unconditional love no matter who we are or what we did. 

-Some show love only through evaluation whether the person is worthy of our love. But this is not unconditional love.

-Jesus tests our love. Who have we shown love to, how have we shown love to our church.

3) God test our faithfulness towards God.

Luke 19:12-26 This is the parable of the 10 minas. The master praised them of their faithfulness as they were faithful even though they were not given much. 

-The master wanted to see whether the servants perform the tasks and made more minas.

-The master wanted them to do business with the minas given. The 10 and 5 minas that was given to the servants, they were faithful as they earned more for their  master unlike the servants given of only 1 mina who did nothing. 

-How do we display our faithfulness to Jesus?

-We should do well in little things with all our heart. 

-How we do attend to this, will reflect our faithfulness towards Jesus?

-Our faithfulness towards God starts with small things. It starts with simple things such as attend services, meditate on his words. 

-Can we walk the talk? So let us start with small matters and we can attend to bigger matters.

-How is our attitude towards Sabbath morning, our attitude towards morning prayer at 9am? This is small matter but can we do this? If we cannot perform well in small matters how can we do big matters?

-What is our spiritual report card when we face Jesus? 

We need to ponder and reflect and continue to improve ourselves so that we can give a good report yearly to our lord Jesus Christ. 

-May God help us all.
