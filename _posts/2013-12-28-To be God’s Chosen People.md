-Deut 7:6-11 God chose the Israelites as his chosen people. Yet they were not perfect as they worshipped to idols, they were a stubborn nation who did not obey God’s commands. Why did God choose them? 

-The answer is in Deut 7:8. But because God loves them. It is an unconditional love.

-The Israelites has great salvation from God as God loves them.

-Deut 7:9-11  Know that God is the faithful God who keeps his convenant and mercy with those who love him and keep his commandments. In these versus we can also know that God is a jealous God. Since God loves the Israelites completely for those who observe his commandments.

-Today we are chosen by God. 

-1 Pet 1:2 Who are the chosen people by God? Those who have the knowledge of God, sanctified by the Spirit and baptized by the blood of Jesus Christ.

-1 Pet 2:2, 5, 10 It is God who chose us to give us the opportunity to return to God through the path of salvation given  by God.

-God loves us and has requirements to those he loves. What are these requirements that God requires of his chosen people?

-Colossians 3:12 As elect of God, we need to be holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering.  These are the characteristics that we have to put on.

-All these differs from Col 3:8 which as Christians we need  to put off anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language.

-As living stone and children of God, we need to put off all these .

-There are some occasions that we understand the commandments of God but yet we are unable to practice this in our daily lives. 

-Eg Can we walk away and keep quiet during a heated quarrel? Can we control our emotions and still be a good example as children of the light?

-If we have a motive to do the best for God, to often remind ourselves and realize our status as the chosen people of God.

-As chosen people of God, we must meditate on the words of God and to practice his words even at the most difficult times.

-Col 3:13 We know Jesus is the head of the body and we are all of one body. 

-1 Cor 12 :12, 24 Not every member is perfect. Yet God composed the body given greater honour to that part which lacks it. 

-Despite of this, there should be no schism and that members should have the same care for one another.

-Col 3:13 bearing with one another and forgiving one another. As Christ has forgiven us, so must we forgive one another.

-Mt 6:14-15  If you forgive men their sins your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

-Although it is not easy to forgive those who have offended us, if we use our love to forgive, similarly our Heavenly Father will also forgive us. 

-We need to have great love to forgive and start talking to those we dislike. We are chosen people of God and we should care and love one another which is the bond of perfection.

-Col 3:15 Let your peace of God rule in our hearts.

-Jn 16:33 We should allow the peace of God to control us. Even though we meet with trials, do not let our worries, our anxiety destroy our faith. 

-When God gives us peace which can control the world. No matter what we face, even though we face worries, anxieties, we know this is temporary and allow the peace live in our hearts and we must learn to entrust. 

-We have to believe that God will take care and arrange for us. 

-As chosen people of God we have much to learn.
