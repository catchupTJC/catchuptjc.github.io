-The book of Nehemiah was written by Nehemiah himself.

-He was captured to Babylon at a young age and served in the palace. Yet his heart still long for Jerusalem

-Neh 1:1-3 At that time Jerusalem was isolated, the wall broken down and the gates were destroyed by fire. 

-Neh 1:11b Nehemiah was the cup bearer of the King and held a high status in the palace. He lived a good life, shared food and drink with the King.

-Yet, although he lived a good life in Babylon, he still cared for Jerusalem.

-Ps 137:5-6 This author will never forget his home as Jerusalem is not only his home but also the center of their faith. 

-Today do we care of the house of God? Do we care of the household of God? Or are we lost in the world forgetting the matters of God.

-Neh 1:4 Nehemiah really cared for the house of God. He mourned and wept and continued fasting and prayed before God

-Some members care the development and future of the church. 

-How do we care? 
-There are different types of care
i) Some will critique
ii) some will just keep quiet and pray about it.
ii) Some will be like Nehemiah, wept & prayed with fasting and took action.

Witnessing
- There was a brother who used to work in France and serve zealously in France. However the mother asked him to return to Taiwan. When he was back, he was busy pursuing his career and earning more money. Later on he was cheated by a family member who ran off with the money. Unfortunately he stood as guarantor for the loan and his house was near to be auctioned. At that time he is also suspected to have cancer. At his lowest period, he wanted to die. He heard his name called. He asked God why this happened to him. God told him that this path taken was his own doing. God asked him to return and to take up and participate in the divine work. After communicating 3 days with God, he went back to church to serve him devotedly. He asked God what is the proof of his calling? God told him that he will joy no matter what happens to him. Even though the bank officer came strangely he had joy in him and welcomed them. The bank gave him 3 months’ time to sell him property rather to auction the property. This is because he can still sell his house for a good price which is sufficient to settle the loan and still have excess to buy a small house. He came back to church and served the Lord. -So when we care about the church, we need to see what the church needs.

-What did Nehemiah do next?

-Neh 2:1-2 God has prepared a way for Nehemiah. King Artaxerxes asked him why Nehemiah was sad. 

-Neh 2:3 When he told the king that his home lies in waste and gates have been destroyed by fire was actually dangerous as the cause of destruction is actually from the King.

-Neh 2: 4-5 The king asked him, what did he want? God made a way for Nehemiah and fulfilled his request. 

-God listened to Nehemiah’s prayer as he cared for the church and his heart is for the church.  

-When God opened a way, this opportunity must be seized. 

-Witnessing
A sister thought of giving up from serving choir although she has learned vocal training as she felt that she had no opportunity to sing solo and the standard of the choir was not up to her expectations.
Later an opportunity was given to her to use her talent to serve God. Although it was not in singing solo, she seized the opportunity to serve God, reminding herself that she should be serving God no matter if she is singing solo or not.

-Sometimes when there is opportunity to serve God, do not push the work especially when you have the ability to do so. 

-Especially when you are youth, you need to seize this time to work for God wholeheartedly. Otherwise we do not have this opportunity to serve God eg if we are old, we may not have the health or energy to do so.

-Neh 2: 11-13 Nehemiah immediately took the opportunity. He went to inspect the walls and started to plan. 

-Neh 2: 17 He told the plan and everybody worked with him .

-When we have the movement in our hearts, we should pray to God and when God has opened a way for you, then we need to pray and think what we must do for God. 

-When we have a plan, we do not work alone but need to get others to work together.

-We cannot have only a few people who cares of the matters of the church, nor a few that a zealous to serve God. 

-It is important to mobilize the whole church members to serve the Lord. 

-Nehemiah is an ordinary member and he had the heart and love for God. He prayed and led the people together to do the work of God. 

-Today we need to ponder carefully what we can do to serve God and to pray for this matter. 

-May God bless us all.
