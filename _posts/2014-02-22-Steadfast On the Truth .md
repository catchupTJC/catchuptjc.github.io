-However even though we have the faith, it is important that we need to be steadfast to stand firm in the truth.

-1 Cor 16:13 We need to standfast in the truth. This is because the way to heaven is not easy.

-Mt 7:13-14 Today we strive to enter the narrow gate which will lead us to a narrow road which will lead us to life.

-Acts 14:21-22, 19 The Jews stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city supposing that he was dead. 

-Yet Paul was able to strengthen the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations that they need to face to enter the kingdom of God.

-In order to believe in Jesus, we need to be steadfast and to face hardships for Christ.

-Today we do not face much hardships or persecutions as we do not face much tribulations in believing in Jesus Christ such as in the past faced by the disciples.

-1 Pet 4:1-4 Jesus in flesh has suffered for us. Today we need not be crucified as Jesus has died on the cross for us. 

-Today we need to resolute that our we do not live in sin. 

-Here Peter encourage them not to live like the people of the world in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, carousing, idolatory etc. 

-Today we should not live a life that is not Christ like. When others go for party, we should not follow. If others smoke, we should not smoke. When everybody breaks the law, then we should not do it. 

-This is a trial and we should stand fast to be firm in the truth. 

-When we do this, we will be persecuted and abuse you. (1 pet 1:4) 

-The people of the world will start to abuse you, persecute you, ridicule you as you are different from the world.

-Journey to heaven is also a journey to serve. 

-1 Cor 15:58 This is how Paul exhort the members in Corinth. To be steadfast, to be immovable, to be abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that in the Lord your labour is not in vain.

-Are we able to be consistent in doing this divine work. 

-We know that when we labour for Jesus, it is not in vain and he will bless us and give us a life of peace. But are we willing to sacrifice and volunteer our time for church?

-How much we give to God, God will bless us according to our works. It is important to do work continuously and be diligent in our work. 

-When we do Godâ€™s work, we must continue to improve and be progressive in divine work. 

-We will face all kinds of trials during our service for the Lord. 

-James 1:2

-There are many dangers in this world as the end of the days are coming near. There will be heresies, love will grow cold and Satan is actively waiting to devour us.

-How do we counter this attack?

-Jude 20 -21 To be steadfast in the truth we need to be steadfast in the truth. 

-In terms of bible knowledge we need to strive for improvement. The more we know, the more we can improve.

-Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom. 

-When we do the work of God, we must remember that the teachings of God must manifest in all your work. 

-Eg the word of God must be in your songs, in your activities, in your service. In this way, we can be steadfast in our truth.

-In fact in some family altars, basic doctrines are part of their program so that their faith can be steadfast in the truth and what they believe in.

-Many members are still not clear about Trinity and one true God. 

-This confusion can also affect our faith and subject us to heresies.

Therefore it is important to know what we truly believe.

-Phil 4:1 Here Paul tells them to stand firm. 

-To rely on Jesus Christ, we must 

1) first know how to pray and entrust to God.
2)Pray for the infilling of the Holy Spirit 
3)To attend church services. 
4) To participate in divine work

-Rom 12:11 We have to be diligent in serving God. There is a lot of church work that we need to participate. 

-The more we work for God, the more we understand the importance of serving to the Lord.

-It is important to be steadfast in the truth as the challenges are many especially in the end days.

-There are a lot of temptations that are at a click or at near distances eg pubs etc. With this temptations, it will draw away members if they are not steadfast.
