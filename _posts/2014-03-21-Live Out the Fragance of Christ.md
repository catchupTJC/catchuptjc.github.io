-Jesus told the disciples to be the light of the world which represents our good conduct for all to see. 

-As disciples of Jesus Christ we should also emit the fragrance of Christ. From the smell we will be able to discern the source and whether it is fragrant.

-2 Cor 2: 14-16 For those who believe in Christ and put the word of Christ in action, they are able to have the aroma of Christ. For those who are saved, their fragrance ie their good conduct will edify them. 

-For those perishing this will not benefit them as they do not believe. 

-For Christians who have good fragrance of Christ, it can save others but for some it does not bring any benefit.

-Today our fragrance is for God. 

-Gen 8:13-14, 18  Although the earth was dried up, yet Noah did not come out from the ark until God instructed  Noah to come out from the ark. 

-Gen 8:20-21 After Noah came out from the ark, the first thing he did was to build an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings. 

-When the Lord smelled the pleasing fragrance, the Lord said that he will never again curse the ground because of man and mete out similar punishment.

-Noah was a perfect man as whatever things he did, he will follow completely the word of God.  God knows he is an upright man as he will submit totally to God’s instruction and will.

-Noah because of his conduct, of his righteousness and uprightness, God listened to the prayer of the righteous. 

-Abraham prayed for 6 times to appeal for the people of Sodom & Gomorrah and finally God fulfilled his request. God listened  because Abraham was an upright & righteous man. God himself said that there is nothing he can do that will be hidden to Abraham.

-Today, we should pray and our prayers should be fragrant in the eyes of God.

-Rev 5:8 Incense refers to the prayers of the saints. The aroma can reach God. Today can our prayers reach God? 

-God will listen the prayers for those who give the best to God, to those who have good conduct and are upright.

-Eph 5:2 Christ loved us and gave himself for us as fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. 

-Our prayers can be fragrant if we have love such as the love of Jesus Christ who are willing to die for our sins.

-Mt 9:35-36 Jesus had a merciful heart and had compassion on the people like sheep without shepherd. Jesus saved them and healed them. Jesus was also willing to die on the cross for them and for us as he loved us.

-The love of Jesus Christ is truly sacrificial. He knows how to use love to forgive others. Before JC died, he prayed to God to forgive the ones who persecuted him for they know not what they were doing. 

-We need to have a merciful heart. For those who are hungry, their need is food. Are there any others who need our help? Do we also see those who lack in material needs? 

-Having a merciful heart is able to see others’ needs and satisfy them for their need is Jesus. 

-When we have this motivation to preach Jesus, we must share Jesus’ gospel and Jesus’ love which is totally sacrificial that he is even willing to sacrifice own self to help others. 

-Our member who is a teacher seeing his students’ poverty was willing to pay for their school fees. Later on he retired and relied on his savings to continued to help others even when he 
had not enough.

-There are members who are willing to sacrifice and fulfill the needs of others who need their help. Their love has emitted fragrance to Jesus. 

-If we have extra money to help others, it is not as sacrificial as those who are lacking and still are able to help others. This is truly sacrificial and to God this is really sweet aroma.

-2 Cor 2: 14-17 To share the fragrance of gospel is to save others. 

-A minister who will climb the hill everyday managed to bring a few to know Jesus Christ. How did he do it? He will approach those who stop for rest and when he found some had problems, he will try to preach to them and take them to church. 

-One of this was a woman who had depression and after believing in Jesus she was healed. Her husband who was a staunched Toaist who had idols in the house automatically threw the idols as he could see the change in his wife after believing in JC.  Her life really changed after receiving the gospel. 

-Under this condition, we should give out the fragrance of the gospel through preaching the gospel to help others and people we know. To allow them to share Jesus to them so that they too can enjoy the peace of Jesus Christ. 

-Does your prayers give out fragrance? Does your love give forth sweet aroma?

-Do you preach the gospel that can give this sweet aroma? To share the gospel for those who need Jesus in their lives.

May Jesus Christ guide us and lead us to live a life of giving out sweet fragrance.
