-As True Jesus Church (TJC) has the complete truth, it is important that the believers must also be complete.

-Rev 3:2 “ Be watchful for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God”. It is important in the last days, the believers must have complete works. 
Rev 3;1 –“I know your works, you have the name of being alive and yet you are dead.” For the true church, we bring the name of Jesus and Jesus is perfect. As such as members, we must be perfect like Jesus.

-Ps 19:7  The law of the Lord is perfect and complete. The words of God is perfect and complete as it will lead us to salvation.

-2 Tim 3:16 The bible is what God wants to guide us. It is for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness for the man of God to be complete. 
The bible is able to guide us what is the good deed we need to do according to God’s will.

-Mt 5:48 You should be perfect just as your heavenly father is perfect. Before this verse, JC tells us that we have to have love even to the point of loving our enemies.

-Gen 17:1 “Walk before me and be blameless”. To be blameless is also the will of God.  We should carry out the perfect truth of God.

-Each member has different gifts such as love, hospitality, preaching etc. 

-Every member has different behavior eg some are sensitive and so we need to be cautious in our speech.

-God has certain standards required of every member and this is important for unity.

-James 1:19 “Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.” 

-This is an important standard for the church and every member.

-If we can practice hospitality, smile, gentle, not quick to anger, have love this will promote a healthy environment in church and out of church

-If we can carry out the complete truth, we shall indeed receive blessings. 
Ps 119:1-3 Blessed are those whose way is blameless who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are those who keep his testimonies and who seek him with their whole heart. Also those who walk in his ways.

-To have faith but no good conduct is incomplete faith. 

-Ps 119;6   Proverbs 20:7 A righteous man who walks in his integrity blessed are his sons after him. If before the Lord we are righteous and perfect, the children will also emulate.  
This is a blessing when man walk blameless in the Lord and have complete truth, blessings will also to be his children who will follow.

-Gen 6:9 In the eyes of God, Noah was perfect as he walked with God. Enoch also walked with God and he was a perfect man. 
God took him away (without going through death) as he was perfect in the eyes of God.

-It is the responsibility of every member to walk in the lord and to be perfect like God. 

-When we are led a strayed, God will punish us to bring us back to the right way because he loves us.

-Numbers 20:6-12 God commanded Moses & Aaron and tell the rock to yield its water. However Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice instead of instructing the rock.

-Because of this slight deviation, God told Moses and Aaron “because you did not believe in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the Israelites” they were not allowed to go to Canaan.

-Deut 3:23-26 Moses who led the Israelites for 40yrs was rejected by God to allow him to enter Canaan.

- Similarly in keeping our faith, it must be complete and not deviate even a little bit. We cannot have an attitude that it is all right and it doesn’t matter to God to deviate a little bit.

-Acts 5:1-6, 8-10. Just this little white lie both Ananias and his wife Sapphira were struck dead. 

-God’s expectation is that we must be perfect. We need to carry out God’s commands completely.

-Do we have love, gentleness, patience, kindness? If we do not have all these virtues, we are not complete. If we do a lot of work for God but do not have love, it is useless. Vice versa, if we only have love, it must go with works.

-Rev 3:3Remember then what you received and heard, keep that and REPENT. Let us remember this and keep the word of God and be perfect.
