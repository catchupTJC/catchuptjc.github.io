-When we are in church we will be aware of our speech & conduct. This is because we honour our righteous God. 

-Some people regard God is love but less emphasis is on the righteousness of God. So what is the percentage that God is love and God is righteous? 50% of each?

-God is actually 100% righteous and 100% love. 

-Is 45:21There is no other God besides Me a just God and a Saviour and there is none besides Me. 

-God is a just God. Our God is only one, a just and righteous God.

-Ps 19: 9  The fear of the Lord is pure, enlightening. The fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever, the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

-Deut 4:8 During this time, the Israelites do not have the law of God and they followed the practices of the Egyptians where they have lived for 400 years. 

-It was that time when Moses came down from Mt Sinai and God personally instructed Moses the commandments and statutes to Moses and the Israelites.

-Deut 4:8-9 It is important to take heed the law and statutes of the law and to teach the children and grandchildren.

-Today laws change which deviate from the teachings of God such as homosexuality which is abominable to God, imprisonment if children are punished etc.

-Lev 19:15 You shall not do injustice in judgment and not be partial to the poor nor honour the person of the mighty. In righteousness you shall judge your neighbour. 

-Rom 2;6 who will render to each according to his deeds. 

-Ez 18:21-29 The righteous God will judge according to the law. So whatever we do, God will judge according to his statutes that is just. 

-Take for example if a sinner repents and decides to depart from his life of wickedness,  God will forgive him. However if a person that has been righteous but at the end turn to wickedness, God will not forgive. So to the Israelites, God is unjust. 

-However this is the standard of God and the righteousness of God.

-The wicked people who learn the word of God and changed their life completely will have the mercy of God. So God is righteous and just. God will look in all aspects.

-Today we have accepted Christ and we understand the teachings and commandments of God. We must therefore be the group that must be righteous and if we don’t do this we will face the punishment of God.

-2 Chronicles 12:1- When Rehoboam has established the kingdom, he forsook the law of the Lord and all Israel along with him. 

-2 Chr 12:2 God allowed King of Egypt against Jerusalem because they transgressed against the Lord.

-2 Chr 12:5-7 “You have forsaken me and therefore I have left you in the hand of Shishak”. The leaders humbled themselves and agree “The lord is righteous” When God saw they humbled themselves, God forgave them and did not destroy them completely. 

-God still punish them as God is a righteous God and the punishment were not as severe.

-Today when we pray to God for forgiveness, God may have mercy and may forgive but God will still punish as God is a righteous God. 

-In the righteousness of God, there is also reward and not merely punishment. 

-Rom 2:6-7 In the righteousness of God, if we do right, God will also reward according to your deeds. God will render eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory , honour and immortality. 

-Look at Paul. In the beginning Paul persecuted the Christians. When he knew that it was Jesus that he was persecuting, he totally repented and serve God totally.

-When God is righteous, if we do righteous things, we should rejoice as we know that God will reward. We should only fear God when we do not do according to God’s righteousness.
