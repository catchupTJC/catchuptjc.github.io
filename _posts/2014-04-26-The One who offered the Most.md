-Mk 12: 41-44 The Passover is held esteemed by the Jews and they will congregate in Jerusalem to observe. Jesus was welcomed warmly by the Jews hailing “Hosanna” and some of them laid garments. 

-After coming into Jerusalem, Jesus was in the temple daily and in during this  time, he saw a widow who offered 2 mites. 

- How did Jesus know that the widow offered 2 mites? Some is of the opinion that some may have dropped bags of money or some said that Jesus heard the sound. But Jesus is God so he knows.

-At this time Jesus wanted to teach the disciples and Jesus said, Verily I say to you that this poor widow has offered the most as she has offered out of her poverty and her living. 

- There are 3 important points to learn from the widow

1)The widow could offer out of her poverty is because she loved God more than anything. As a widow there is no need for her to offer as by right widows required help from the church.

-Acts 6:1 This widow led a lonely life in poverty. During this time, they were without support and was bullied. 

-Mk 12:38-40 During this time, the society bullied the widows as they did not have their husbands to protect them and lost their possessions.

-Yet the widow could offer her all despite her condition and environment.

-There are Christians who are able to offer and sacrifice their entire life for Jesus, offering all their might, their wealth, their time to serve God. Why can they do this?

-They are motivated by the love of Christ.

-1 Tim 1: 12-14 The motivation of Paul was inspired by the love of Christ. 

-How can Paul feel this way?

-It was because once he was a sinner and yet Jesus chose him to be Jesus vessel. He felt the grace, mercy and love of Jesus. Paul was willing to sacrifice his entire life to preach the gospel and fulfill the mission of Jesus Christ for him.

-Today do we really feel the motivation of Jesus’ love?  

-If we feel the love of Jesus we are willing to have the same motivation of Paul and similarly to this widow.

-Today is our offering similar to this widow’s offering?

-This offering is not measured by value but by sacrifice. 

-If we truly say we love Jesus, we will automatically sacrifice our life to Jesus. This love is similar to the parental love towards their children.

-Eg parents are willing to sacrifice themselves in the fire to save their children.

-How can this widow offer so much? 

-We know during this time the widows themselves need help but this widow who had received the 2 mites offered all that she had to the treasury.

-Everyone will think first before they offer to the Lord to ensure that their family and livelihood will be secured first.

-This widow had the foresight to see the future.

-1 Pet 1:8-9 Without seeing Jesus, yet they have the faith. 

-How far can our faith take us? 

-Eg our purchase of the new church, where is our faith level? Are we constrained by the problems, the lack of funds? 

-We entrust to God and it is important we see with our faith. 

-Heb 11:13 In chapter 11 it tells many characters of people with strong faith such as Noah, Enoch, Abel, Abraham. 

-These people died in faith not having received what was promised.

-Today there are a lot of things, we need to have faith that can transcend over problems/issues/challenges.

-When we have the faith, we will use all our might, our all and sacrifice in entirety just like this widow who offered her all. 

-The moral of Jesus’ teaching is the attitude when we do offering.

-Mk 12:41 Jesus does not see the amount but the attitude of offering. 

-Jesus sees our offering measured by our attitude towards our service to the Lord, our zeal towards attending service, our sacrifice to our Lord Jesus.
