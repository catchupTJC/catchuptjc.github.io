-Mt 17:1 Jesus took Peter, James & John and led them on a high mountain. Some speculate that this high mountain may be Mt Tabur or a high mountain near Galilee. However it is the will of God that the name of this mountain was not mentioned

-Luke 9:28-29 It is the habit of Jesus to go up to the high mountain to pray. At this time as he prayed, his face was altered and His robe became white and glistering. It was at this time that Jesus was transfigured. 

-The disciples was at this time sleeping.

-When Jesus was transfigured at the high mountain this is a rarity and the disciples managed to see this. 

-It was at this time Jesus was praying at this high mountain Jesus transfigured and his robe became white and glistering. 

-In the book of Matthew it describes the robe of Jesus became white as light 

-The difference between this prayer is that Jesus’ prayer has achieved the highest point of which he has touched God. 

-Ex 34: 1, 28-29  Moses was with God for  40 days and night and he neither ate nor drink. 

-He was with God and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant of the 10 commandments. 

-When he had face to face conversation with God, his face shone. This incident did not happen until Jesus transfiguration

-If a person has close communication with God whereby he constantly is in prayers with God, drawing near to God. Their conduct, their countenance also is shinning like of God. 

-Today we are Christians and have close relationship with God and we often have communion with God, by right we should have the countenance of God.

-Since we have the spirit of God by right we should have a very close communion with God. Do we have such close relationship with God?. Do we manifest the glory of God? If not then we have a problem in our spirituality?

-Moses was with God for 40 days and night and his face shone. If we have the spirit of God day and night then would our face not shine with God’s glory. 

-Jesus robe was white and glistering. Robe in the bible spiritually means our conduct. 

-Rev 19:6, 8 This is the time when Jesus is coming and there was a voice of a great multitude and mighty sound  Amen! Alleluia!. They wore fine linen clean and bright. The fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. 

- Members of God must also wear this white, bright and clean robe whereby members should be holy and righteous.

- We as Christians come to church, read the bible, pray, serve the Lord, do we spiritually feel close to God? How intimate is our relationship with our Lord God? Do we do all this out of duty bound as outward appearance it is as if we have an intimate relationship with God. 

-However spiritually we may not be close to God. If we still feel weak, far away from God, we do not feel joy, then we need to examine ourselves as we have challenges in our spiritual life.

-1 Cor 2:10, 14 God revealed to us through His Spirit For the spirit searches all things. However the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish nor can he know them because they are not spiritually discerned. 

-When we pray, we need to pray with our hearts only then we can touch and experience God. Similarly in listening the sermon are we touched by God’s words.

-Those who are close communion with God, they can truly feel the joy, they can feel the strength from God. In their conversations, their daily lives is full of God and is filled with joy and they rejoice in serving and coming to church services. 

-Luke 9:30 Moses resembles the old testament, the priest in the old testament. Elijah represents prophets in the Old testament. He is the spokesman of God and perform judgment of God. Jesus Christ represents the New Testament. 

-When the disciples woke up and saw the transfiguration, Peter said that it is good to be there and built 3 tabernacles one for Moses, one for Elijah and one for Jesus. 

-Although Peter has not seen Moses and Elijah yet in spirit, Peter knew that it was Moses and Elijah. 

-For someone who knows the matters of the spirit, do you think tabernacles would be important?

- Although Peter saw this vision, he actually did not know what was happening. In spirit he was still immature. 

-Jn 16:12 The disciples were unable to understand what Jesus had told them because they were spiritually still not mature. 

-If we do not go into the spirit, we will not be able to understand the kingdom of the Lord. 

-We should enter the spirit by praying. Are we weak in our prayers? Do we pray earnestly ? For those who pray earnestly they love to pray. When someone loves God, he will love to come to church and they will love to serve God. 

-When you see yourself where are you now? Are you the one who likes to read the bible? Are you the one who loves to serve the Lord? Are you the one who rejoice in coming to Church? 

-We should grow in our faith. Today we should ponder whether we are in spirit or in flesh. Is my heart with God or my heart is in the world? Is my prayer in spirit with God or are we faraway. 

-Jesus was praying in the high mountain and could achieve the spiritual realm. 

-If all of us attains this spiritual realm, then our church will be a church that has God’s power.
