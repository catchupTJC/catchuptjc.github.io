-Rev 19:6-19 The fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints. 

-In chapter 19 is the 4th time Hallelujah was shouted as the Lamb of God has come. 

-The lamb represents Jesus Christ. 

-The wedding is the time when Jesus has come to take us up again.

-The bride represents the church. 

-Jesus has said that he will prepare a place for us. It will be a glorious time when Jesus comes again. 

-Is the bride ready to receive the Lamb of God. Is the church ready today to receive Jesus. 

-If you see today is the church glorious and perfect? 

-The bride must shine and when the church is able to emit this beautiful bride then she is ready to receive the bridegroom Jesus.

-As members in the last day, Jesus will receive all of us and receive the church that is glorious, shinning and ready. 

-Song of Solomon 6:10 This whole book of Song of Solomon reflects the love of Jesus and us. If we have not establish the loving relationship with our Lord Jesus, then we will mistakenly take this book as a physical love story.

-Who spoke this verse? It was the people around her that asked. “Who is the one who looks forth as the morning fair as the moon, clear as the sun?”

-This is because the appearance has completely change. Here the appearance has changed because of the 3 different lights ie the light of the dawn, the light of the moon and the light of the sun.

-The bride of the church must prepare to emit the lights. 

-1) The church to emit the light of dawn

The light of dawn is the first appearance of light after night and through this light darkness will fade away. This is the light of hope.

-Is 60:1 Arise and shine and the glory of God shines upon you. 

-When the light appears, it will shine on you and the light will cover all the darkness. 

-Jn 8:12 The light of Jesus will take away the darkness. Jesus said he is the light of the world. When Jesus Christ came in the world there is hope in the world. 

-When Jesus died on the cross to take away our sin, we have hope to live a new life, a hope to put away our old self and put on a new self and life. 

-This bride which is the church will have the light of hope in us

-Some may feel disappointed in the church or members and they distanced from church. Some may have good feelings, received love and truth and they have then hope in the church. So the hope in the church depends on the emotions or situations that each member feels? It should not.

-The hope in church should be based on the hope in Jesus Christ, in the hope of the salvation grace given by the Lord Jesus Christ.

-Hope in the church should not be based on physical emotions or feelings but based on the hope in Jesus.

-As long as the church has the presence of the truth, the abidance of the Holy Spirit then this church have hope as we all hold on the truth and the spirit. 

-We need to let others to find and see the light of dawn. 

-It is true that not all members, ministers, leaders are not perfect. We all have a shortcoming or weaknesses and it is important that the strong will need to cover the weaknesses. 

-Eg those who have more love, then let those who have more love cover those who are less have love. We are all very unique and God wants us to complement each other well so that the church will emit the light of dawn. 

-When people come to the church they will see hope that is to be like Jesus Christ so that the spiritual self will be more beautiful.

-2) The church emit the light of the moon.

-Song of Solomon 6: 10. It says fair as the moon. The moon does not have light as the moon light comes from the sun. 

-When the moon reflects the light of the sun, the moon is beautiful even though in actual fact the surface of the moon is full of craters and it is not as smooth. 

-The moonlight is beautiful because it comes from the sun. We can directly see the moon to see the light of the sun. 

-The light of the moon is a gentle light and this is the beauty of the bride. 

-Although she has many imperfections, this light has covered all her imperfections. This is the spiritual nurture. If we have done our spiritual nurture well we can be a perfect person. 

-To be a complete and perfect church, we as members need to have complete spiritual nurture effort of every member. A perfect church will have a perfect spiritual nurture. 

-This spiritual nurture comes from the words of God and when the members listen to the words of God and is able to execute them. 

-Jesus said, we are the Light of the World and as light of the world we should practice the word of God and our conduct must be Christ like. 

-A good spiritual nurture is to pursue goodness inside and outside. It is important to have good character and conduct.

-If we are the light of the moon and to reflect the light of the sun, Jesus Christ. 

-If our spiritual nurture is good, people would like to draw near to you and can see your goodness and it is easy to preach to them. 

-Is our spiritual nurture just for appearance or coming to church is just a routine? This is something that we should not fall in this snare and be cautious. 

-There should be good harmony and relationship among members. With this love, harmony then the church can continue to grow and be beautiful like the moon

3) The church to emit the light of the sun
Apart from the light of the dawn, moon we need the light of the sun where it is the brightest. 

-Rev 12:1 This woman refers to the church and after that she was attacked by the dragon, Satan. The woman was clothed with the sun. This means the church has the light of the sun which is totally without blemish and is pure and holy. 

-If we depend on ourselves it is impossible but with the blood of Jesus Christ we are washed clean as our sins has completely taken it away.

-The blood of Jesus has its effect not only during baptism but even after baptism as it still has the effect of cleansing. 

-Eph 5:26-27 To make it holy through washing of water by the word. When we listen to a sermon and the words of God guide us and if we have not done it, we should repent of our sins. The cleansing can be done by listening to the word of God and when members listen, repent and practice the words of God, then the church can be complete. 

-In the future the church will face the test of fire. When fire has passed through this place, only those who still standing will be saved. 

-The church will face its test which we do not know. This test will test the faith of our members. If the foundation of the faith is not good, they will fall away. 

-Those who are still standing after facing the fire will be saved and the church will be a glorious church.
