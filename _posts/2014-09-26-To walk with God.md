-Is attending services or doing divine service walking with God?

-We are suppose to walk with God. Are we really walking with God?

-Gen 5:22-23 Here mentioned Enoch walked with God. However this does not describe how Enoch walk with God.

-When man was cast away from the Garden of Eden how did man walked with God?

-Unlike the time when Adam was in the garden of Eden, God could talk to Adam face to face and it was easy to walk with God.

-Heb 11:5 Enoch walked with God and did not see death. He pleased God. 

-How do we walk together with God as we do not have the same faith with God?

-Amos 3:3 Can two walk together unless they are agreed?

-When two walk together, both must be in agreement. God is the most holy, most high and therefore God cannot be the same status with us.

-However in our hearts, we can be like Christ. In order to have the heart of Christ we need to know what Christ is pleased with, his demands and requirements.

-We should therefore know and actually do what pleases God. We also should know what God is displeased with so that we will not do it. 

-Ex 20:3-5 Here God mentions of the 10 commandments. In the first few commandments it is clear that you cannot have any other gods before Me. You cannot make any graven images and not bow them for God is a jealous God.

-If you love Him he will love you until your next generations and if you disobey his commandments and hate him, God too will hate them including his generations.

-Num 25:1-3 The Israelites sinned against God. The Israelites commit harlotry with the women of Moab and offered sacrifices to their gods and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. 

-The anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel and God gave Moses a cruel instruction that is to slay all these Israelites who committed harlotry with the Moabites women and worship Baal.

-God’s hands was also against all the Israelites and the plague started amongst the Israelites. Phinehas saw it and rose among the congregation and killed the man of Israel and the Midianite woman and the plague stopped. All together 24K died.

-God’s anger stopped when Phinehas did what God wanted and it pleased God that he was doing according to God’s will.

-Today we need to have the same heart with God. This must be according to God’s commands and instruction. Walking with God does not mean walking in your own way and interpreting you will against God’s will.

-Luke 9:51-54 Jesus passed through Samaria, no one receive Him because Jesus was going to Jerusalem. James & John saw this, they said to Jesus, “Lord do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them just as Elijah did?”

-Jesus rebuke them “you do not know what manner of spirit you are of?”

-What was Jesus spirit when he came to the earth? He came to save sinners and not to punish and judge them. The Day of Judgment will only come during his 2nd coming. 

-So the disciples’ spirit and heart is incongruent with Jesus’ spirit. 

-When we think that we are very spiritual and think we are knowledgeable, we think we are doing “God’s” work but in actual fact, we are not doing God’s will and what God is pleased with. 

-God’s will cannot be changed and it is important to do according to the will of God. 

-We need to humble ourselves and whatever we do must be in accordance to God’s teachings. 

-If we are very close to God, we know our God is a  humble God and is submissive. Therefore it is important that we need to be submissive and humble and then God will work with those who are these nature.

-James 4:13-16 These people are boasting. We should say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that”.

-In doing our own will and then ask God to bless our work. This is not walking with God. 

-To walk with God means walking according to His will, His commandments and God will then bless our work.

-We need to submit the will of God and his commands then this is being submissive to his will.

-1 Cor 3:9 We are God’s fellow workers you are God’s field you are God’s building.

-As God’s fellow workers, we need to walk with God and do what he pleases. 

-Eg preaching is everybody’s work. We will do our best to participate in divine work may it be a worker, a participant, to invite friends. When we do God’s work, we are walking with God.

-Apart from preaching, we can do pasturing. Is pasturing work only confine to ministers only? No. Everybody can do pasturing eg Head of the family should pastor their children and families well. 

-How do we pastor our children or families well? Take them to green pasture and calm water which is bringing them to spiritual nurture ie to give them spiritual food. 

-The shepherd is a role model ie the lambs will follow where the shepherd go. The family head must be a spiritual role model. 

-Similarly we have ministers who are supposed to be shepherd and therefore they should be leaders and the members should follow.

-Ministers and committee members are important and they are supposed to be shepherd to lead the members.

-If you are hired servant and do the 3 years term only and only do what is required. If that is the case, we are just working for the church and not doing God’s work.

-Apart from being the same heart of Jesus we also need to walk with God in terms of work. Eg Enoch walk with God for 300 years and Elijah also work with God and was taken up without seeing death. Jesus was also ascended to heaven and this is what we hope for when we are resurrected in the Last Days together with Christ. We too will ascend up to Heaven.

1 Thess 4:17 We who are alive and remain shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. When that day comes, those who walk with God can be caught up. So we need to question ourselves, have we walked with God when this Day comes?
