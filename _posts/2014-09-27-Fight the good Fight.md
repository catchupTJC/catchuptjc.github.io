-2 Tim 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race I have kept the faith. 

-This verse are used for members who have been called to the Lord and are able to keep their faith.

-While we are alive, we are keeping our faith but how do we fight a good fight spiritually?

-To fight a good fight requires all of our might, effort, energy to fight our evil one which is the Devil.

-In our deeds, behaviours we do the will of God, we are fighting a good fight.

-The first requirement to fight a good fight we must have God as our commander and leader.

-Joshua 5:13-15 When Joshua was by Jericho, he fligted up his eyes and saw a man standing before with drawn sword in his hand. Joshua said to him “Are you for us or by our enemies.” And he said, “ I am the commander of the army of the Lord. Now I have come” Immediately Joshua fell on his face and worshiped him.

-The man who is the commander of the army of the Lord was actually leading the army of the Joshua although Joshua was physically leading the Israelites. 

-When Joshua worship this commander of God, he was totally submissive to this commander which is to totally to obey God’s commandments.

-Jericho was a well fortified city and was not easy to conquer. The commander gave the instruction of God that they had to march around the city once and do it for 6 days. On the 7th day they shall march around the city 7x. This is indeed not man’s method and is a strange requirement from God.

-However the battle was won and the glory was given to God according to God’s method and will. 

-Joshua 6:26

-When we fight a good fight, we have to have GOD as our commander and as our leader. The victory belongs to God and is not due to our own effort.

-When we face our problems, we normally rely our self to resolve the problems as the fastest way. But if we rely to God, we will pray and ask God to guide and entrust on God to resolve the problems.

-In God’s time. We always hope that the problem will be resolved at our own time. The faster the better. 

-However when we pray and entrust to the Lord, we have to wait patiently to the will of God. Once it is resolved, he will give glory to God that God has helped to solve the problem.

-Have we in our lives, do we really use this method to solve our problems. 

-Eg when we meet with sickness, can we still rely on Jesus to totally to pray and wait for the will of God to be accomplished. Can we still give glory to God?

-When we fight a good fight, we need to have the life of faith to rely on God to trust completely the Lord. 

-A sister fell at home and hit her head. Her head bled and she was in coma and was admitted to the hospital. After the MRI scan, the doctor told her daughter that the mother had a stroke and there was bleeding in the head. The daughter is a member of the church and immediately contacted the church. The members prayed hard for her and everytime when prayer was done, her condition got better day by day. Although the doctor that her condition is serious. The next day she open her eyes with no response. The doctor said that although she could open her eyes, she may be brain damaged. Day by day, she could move her hands, later she could open her mouth but could not utter any words, now she is in the normal ward and is conscious. 
Everybody had a deep impression as they could only pray and rely on God. The doctor could only do so much and they can only say they can have a surgery to remove the clot. They could not help in the improvement of her health. Everybody was edified when they saw the power of prayer how God has intervened to help and improve her condition day by day.

-The process of the fight is important as when we rely on the power of God totally we are fighting a good fight.

-In one Taiwan church, they were invited to give a talk to the church. Before they organized it, they asked the members who are interested in participated in this divine work they ask them to come to church to pray during that time when they conduct the seminar. When the person in charge came back from the seminar, it was successful and was full of confidence that God was in the midst as this is the power of the prayer of the members in church.

-Eg Evangelistic meeting, the choir members need to pray but as members in church, do we also pray diligently for God’s power to work mightily in our midst? 

-All of us need to fight a good fight is to participate in this divine work is to pray to God to help to resolve all problems. 

-Eg if we do divine work and face criticisms, we should not be discourage but more importantly we should know that we need to fight a good fight and soldier on diligently to pursue in the work for God.

-Jude 20-24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless. 

-It is important that we need to preserve the truth no matter what. The truth must be preserve no matter what is the trend, the values in the world that has changed.

-When we protect the truth, we need to know first what is the truth.

-A brother was thrown in the sea for days and how Jesus saved him to stay afloat and later was saved. He became very zealous for the Lord but he did not have any foundation of truth. At first he said Jesus was his savior and then later he said it is not Jesus but Jehovah. 

-Sometimes when we have a good foundation, we want to serve the Lord, Satan will try to do all methods such as church is not supportive, face personal problems, lack of love. When this trials come, can this still shake the foundation of our belief.

-When we fight a good fight, we have to protect the truth and emphasis is on other things. Eg some complaints is that this member lacks love or this member lacks faith but because of the weakness in the church that does not affect the truth that saves. If the truth has changed, then the Holy Spirit would have left the church. But if our regard is towards man instead of the truth then we are at the wrong path.

-To fight a good fight, we need to preserve the truth and to know the truth. To read the bible more, to participate in seminars, to study more, to read more of our church publications etc. 

-Phil 1:27 Paul asked them to stand firm in one spirit during their absence. During the last day, there are a lot things that happen in the world will affect the truth. So it is important that we preserve the truth.  

-We should not be affected by the articles of the world who will try to refute the existence of God and the bible is fake. 

-That is why we need to stand firm in the Holy spirit.The Holy Spirit is real and we can experience it ourselves and we know it is not face. Therefore we should never be influenced by the trends of the world. 

-Let us continue to stand firm in one spirit to fight the good fight.
