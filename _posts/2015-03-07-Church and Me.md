Acts 2: 40-44
These verses speak of the day of the Pentecost  whereby the apostles and the believers in Christ had fellowship and broke bread

Lessons to be learned here:
1)	Preaching through our actions.
As a Christian, we have to conduct ourselves in a way that displays a reflection of Christ.

We need to be a living testimony.

In comparison to some of the other denominations, we might be perceived by many as being out-dated with most of the other churches praising the Lord with music bands.

But the church must only have one foundation.
The emphasis of the church must not be misplaced in just the music alone but in the Lord’s word.

2)	Love needs to be present in the church

Galatians 5: 1 & 13
Acts 2: 42

3)	Fellowship
No man is an island in this spiritual journey
We need the support of our brothers and sisters.

Looking at figure of the cross,
The horizontal line represents the relationship of men and men whereas the vertical line represents God.

It also through the fellowship with members in the church that we can find true friends.

In Japan & Korea, most of the working class people would rather have their meals with their colleagues than to go back to their homes.

This is partly due to their small houses and households.
Let this not happen to us.

1 John 2: 10
Whoever loves his brother lives in the light.
Support from our brethren is fundamental in building our relationship with God.

Going back to Acts 2, what is the breaking of bread that the bible refers to?

The breaking of bread has been mentioned several times in the bible, eg: the Lord’s prayer.

What is meant here is that in fellowship we need to have meals together, to fulfill our physical sustenance.

Moving on, the lower portion of verse 42 emphasizes on prayer. This is our spiritual sustenance.

Acts 2: 43
It speaks the members were filled with awe and fear if the many signs and miracles done by the apostles.
The members here feared the Lord.

It is important to note that although we may carry out the Lord’s work, we cannot perceive ourselves as invincible from faltering in our faith.

We need to open our hearts and minds to the words of the Lord still. Never forget to praise the Lord.

Our fellowship must always contain 2 ingredients; breaking of bread and prayer
