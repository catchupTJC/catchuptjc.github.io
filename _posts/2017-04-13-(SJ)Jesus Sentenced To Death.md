-Before Jesus was sentenced to death, he underwent six rounds of judgment

-Serving of judgment may sometimes be frustrating with crooks having at times being able to walk away freely

-And those who condemned Jesus wanted to prove that they were righteous in their own right

-John 18: 12-13
This was the first judgment of Jesus. He was bound at the Garden of Gethsamene.

-Jesus was bound in a manner that prisoners and sinners would have been treated – they had even gone after Him with swords

-Now although the soldiers came barging in with their weapons, Jesus told His disciples to resist the arrest.

-Jesus even went on to heal one of his captors who had cut open his ear.
-It was also recorded that when Jesus proclaimed Himself as Jesus of Nazareth that the soldiers fell back-  it was an unexpected move

-One of His closest disciples, Peter had also denied Him three times. 

-All these were the sequence of events that led to the judgment of Jesus
-The first judgment was attended by elders, scribes and members of the court.

-John 18: 24
-This explains the second judgment of Jesus – He was brought before Caiaphas (a high priest)

-It was here that Peter denied Jesus and additional two times (verse 25-27). Peter bear false testimony against Jesus.
-The Third Judgment (Verse 28)
-Jesus was then led to Pilate in the Court of the Romans
-The previous two were held in the court of the Jews – usually the romans wouldn’t interfere with the judgment of the Jews

-So why was it that Jesus was brought to the Court of Roman – it was because court of Jews weren’t allowed to put a death sentence.

-Verse 29-31
-The Jews then claimed Jesus as a criminal before Pilate
-Pilate insisted that this was out of his jurisdiction, it should have been under the law of Jews.

-But the Jews wanted to execute Jesus

-Let us also take note that the same Jews who wanted to execute Jesus did not enter the palace to meet Pilate; they wanted to be able to attend the Passover (the place was unclean) – it was hypocritical of them to proclaim to be safeguarding their spiritual faith when they themselves wanted blood

-Luke 23: 1-4
-Their accusation of Jesus was that He opposed the payment of taxes. It was a clear message that they wanted to test the teachings of Jesus or more likely, to corner Him
-Now Jesus did not explicitly preached to not pay taxes but in fact mentioned to pay Caesar what he is due.

-The accusation brought against Him was baseless

-The Fourth Judgment (Luke 23: 6-12)
-When Pilate found out that Jesus was a Galilean, he was then sent to Herod (He would have fallen under Herod’s jurisdiction)
-But Herod merely wanted to see Jesus perform miracles – he was corrupt and abused his authority

-We shouldn’t base our faith in the Lord solely with the intention of experiencing signs and miracles

-Now Pilate and Herod weren’t exactly in the best of relationships either but because for a common interest (to punish Jesus) they were willing to form an alliance
-Luke 23:15
-Pilate and Herod couldn’t find any evidence of the accusations made by the Jews.

-However, Pilate still wanted the buy-in of the public or in this case, the Jews. Therefore, he insist that he would punish Jesus first before releasing Him.

-At one point, Pilate had to even plead to the crowd three times that Jesus was undeserving of the death penalty as He was an innocent man – however, it was futile; the crowd wanted to shed His blood

-It was a case of the voice of the public overthrowing the decision of a top justice official. Eventually, Pilate gave in to the demand of the crowd and released Jesus to them and to do as they please.

-Jesus then had to endure a series of punishment and to add salt to injury, He had to carry the cross on His own of which would be used for His crucifixion

-Would have we at that point in time helped Jesus to carry the cross?
