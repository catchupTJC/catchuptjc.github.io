-We can learn the animals recorded in the bible. 
-In the first part we learnt about the snake in the Garden of Eden. The serpent spoke the words of the devil. While the donkey that spoke to Balaam spoke the words of God. 
-Dog in the bible
Lk 16:19-26. Here the dogs licked the sores of Lazarus who was a poor man and was a beggar covered with painful sores. 
-The  meaning of the name of Lazarus means the God that helps. 
-However Lazarus life was indeed pitiful from the description of the bible and did God really help him when he was on earth? It does not seem to be.   
-But when Lazarus died, he was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. 
-The dogs that licked the sores of Lazarus is probably his companions and protector. The dogs were trying to heal the sores of Lazarus using their own way by licking the pus that came out from the sores.
-The rich man instead had no pity on Lazarus. The rich man could have asked his servant to help Lazarus to feed him and help him to heal his sores.
-Because he did not do it, when the rich man died, he went to Hades. 
-This is the parable spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ. 
-Today is there a Lazarus in our midst? In our daily lives, we 
should not be like the rich man that did not care or extend any help when there is Lazarus in our midst. 

-Rooster
Mk14:27-31 Peter vehemently declared that he will never deny Jesus. Jesus said, “Truly I tell you this very night before the rooster crows twice you will deny me 3 times. Peter emphatically said, :If I must die with you I will not deny you”. And the rest of the disciples said the same. 
-So did Peter deny Jesus? 
-Mk 14:66-72 Peter indeed denied knowing Jesus three times before the rooster crowed twice. 
-The rooster who crowed to remind Peter and only on the second time, did Peter realize what Jesus had told Peter.
-Are we like Peter sometimes? Are we still in slumber physically and spiritually? 
-Who can wake us up spiritually ? 
-Peter was only woken up by the rooster when it crowed 
twice and this was in the middle of the night.
- Once Peter was awaken by the crow of the rooster, then Peter remembered the words of Jesus Christ. 
-Today preachers, ministers are like the rooster to remind us that we should not slumber as the coming of our Lord Jesus is at hand.
-In church we are able to wake up from the slumber and to remember the words of God.
-Mk 14:68,70, 72 At first Peter denied. Second
 time he denied again. The last time he began to invoke a 
curse and to swear.
