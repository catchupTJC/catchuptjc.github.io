Gen1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
Gen 1:2-3
In the beginning is the beginning of creation. Eternity is before the beginning as God is eternity and has no beginning.
In John 1 The word ie God is even before the beginning. 

1)The archaic world – probably when the dinosaurs etc existed. 
2)The destruction of world when there is no life or form
3)The creation of the world – Let there be light, this is the creation of the world. 

So the earth has actually gone through 3 phases which is the archaic world, the destruction of the world and the creation of the world. 
How do we prove this? 
 Scientific proofs
1)The theory regarding the explosion of the universe ie the big bang theory. 
In science, there is a big explosion and after this came this beautiful earth. This big bang theory, before it the form was formless. After this destruction then came this beautiful world. 
However science can only explain Gen 1:2 where the earth was formless. 
2)The age of the universe 
Science proven that universe existed billion of years. But Adam & eve time to now is about 6000 years. 
3) The age of the earth - is more than 6K years
4) The fossil prior to the history - The fossil has been found on earth is more than 6K years eg dinasours 
5) The era of the ice age
In the ice age, the earth has no light, no sun and everything was frozen. 
Job 9: 5-10 Here talks about the anger of God. In God’s anger he destroyed the original world. He removes the mountains, shakes the earth out of its place, commands the sun not rise and seals up the stars, who stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea. So when the sun does not rise, the whole world will be frozen and the earth was in darkness.

-Job9;8 this supports Gen 1;2 when God began recreated the world that is destroyed as the earth was filled with water.  

-God did not create 3 earth but it is at the same earth that is the archaic world, 

-Job 9:1-4, 12 Job asked 5 questions 
1)How can a man be righteous before God?
2)Who can dispute before God?
3)Who can hardened himself against God and succeed? 
The beautiful angel that went against God can he succeed
4)If God wants to take something, who can stop him? 
There is respect and honour and reverence towards God.
5)Who can question God?
This is the foolishness and pride of man to question man. 

God destroyed the earth as there was something that displeased God and arouse God’s anger. 

Job 9:5-6 God destroying the original earth. 
Job 9:7 The sun, stars not shinning and the earth was frozen in the ice age.      
Job 9:8 the creation of the world and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 

Gen 1: 1 in the begininig god created eht heavens and the earth. – The creation of the archaic world
Gen 1: 2 the earth was without form and voice and darknessw was over the face of the deep. This is the destruction of the archaic world. 

Gen 1: 3 And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of he waters. The earth was covered with water. 

Biblical proofs
Ps 104:5-9 He set the earth on its foundations so that it should never be moved. You covered it with the deep as with a gamrnet. The waters stood above the mountains, oYou set a boundary that they may not pass so that hey mih not again cover the earth. 

From these few versus, God destroying the initial world and put it under water. 

Ps 104:6 refers when earth was destroyed
Ps 104:7-8 refers when God began to create the world in Gen 1:3
Ps 104:9 God set boundary that they may not pass so that God commanded the water cannot cover the earth again. 
Ps 104:30 the destroyed earth was recreated and renewed. When you send forth your spiritu they are created and you neew the face of the ground. 

Is 24: 1 the Lord will empty the earth and make it desolate. Why did God destroy this beautiful earth. The answer is in vs 19
Is 24:19 the earth is utterly broken, is split apart the earth 
Jer 4:23-26 the earth was formless and empty because the fierce anger of the Lord. 
Is 45:18 God who created the heavens he is God who formed the earth and made it. He established it he did not create it empty he formed it to be inhabited. 
-The lord created the world and did not leave the earth empty. 
The earth was empty as it was judged by God. 

-God created the heavens and formed the earth. The original Create here is bala which means to create something out of nothing. 
In the beginning created the heavens and earth (bala created here means something out of nothing ) Subsequently in Gen 1:3 onwards the word create in original used the word asah which means to create from something to something else. 

2 Pet 3:3-7 Knowing this first of all that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing following their own sinful desires, the y will say, where is the promise of his coming forever since the fathers fells asleep all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation. For they deliberately overlook this fact that the heavens existed long ago and the earth was form out of water and through water by the world of God and that by means of these world that then existed was deluged with water and perished but by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. 

2 Pet 3: 5-6 God has destroyed the earth before. 
Peter said Gen 1:1God created the heavens and the earth which was the original archaic world.
2 Pet 3: 6 was judgement of God. The world was destroyed 
2 pet 3: 7 when will the present earth and earth destroyed? This  will be kept until the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly. 

The beginning, the archaic world,   the destruction of the world,   the creation of the present world. 
Gen 2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created (bala) In the day that the Lord God made (asah) the earth and the heavens 

God created the earth again, he did not create water. When was the water created? This clearly tells us that before the creation of the earth the water was already created in the archaic world.
