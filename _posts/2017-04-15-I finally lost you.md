-In our lives, sometimes we can be at our lowest ebb eg losing someone we love.
-In the bible we have incidents where everything is lost such as in the incident in the garden of Eden. 
-Gen 3:24 Adam & Eve was cast out from the Garden of Eden and God has placed cherubim to guard the tree of life so that no man can eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.
- God commanded Adam & Eve not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. However out of so many fruit of the trees, Adam & Eve went against God command and ate it.
-Gen 3:9  Even though God knew that Adam & Eve had sinned yet God called out to Adam “Where are you? 
-God gave them an opportunity to repent when he asked. “Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
-Instead of repenting and confessing their sins, Adam pushed the blame to Eve and Eve blamed the serpent. 
-Their sin caused a great loss not only themselves but a loss to all mankind.

2) 1 Samuel 4:19-22 This is concerning the tragedy of the family of Eli. 
-The wife of Phinehas gave birth and name her son Ichabod at 
the point of her death  which means the glory has departed 
from Israel. 
-This is because the ark of God was captured and her father in law and her husband was dead. God has departed from Israel.

-The word of God was rare during this period as no one wanted to hear the word of God. They just wanted to hear the words of men and totally forsook the word of God. 

-Eventually the glory of God departed. 
-In the True Jesus Church it is important to continue to preach 
the word of God so that the presence and glory of God will 
continue to abide in the church. 

-The wife of Phinehas was in labour and women attending her comforted her saying, “Do not be afraid for you have borne a son” This is because of the males in the family has died ie the husband and the father in law as well and even the brother in law. 
-However this mother did not answer or pay attention. She was more concern about the glory of God has departed than her son.

-Today we should be concern and be focus on God and not on worldly matters. 

-Just like this mother who was more concern that the glory of 
God has departed which is a shame and hence the name 
Ichabod which means the glory of God has departed.

-In the past ark of covenant will ensure victory for the Israelites. Even the enemies they were afraid as the ark of covenant represents the God of Israel. This time, even with the ark of covenant they lost the battle and even the ark of covenant was taken away by the enemies. 

-Only then, they knew that God and his glory has departed 
from Israelites. 

-When God was with them, they neglected God and when God’s glory departed, they want to seek God but it was too late as they have lost it. 
-Today we should not lose God and always ensure God is in our presence and in our church. 
-3) Judges 16:19-20 This is the story of Samson. When the Lord has departed from him, he was still not aware of his loss. 
-When Samson was chosen by God, he already did not want to obey God’s command. He insisted doing his own will as he was indeed a very strong man. 
-When his hair was cut, his strength left him. Under the command of God, he cannot cut his hair. 
-Nothing on earth could bound him but his lust with Delilah a prostitute was his downfall. 
-He lost because he  did not heed the words of God and eventually fell in the hands of his enemies. His both eyes were gouged out. 
-In prison, he was used to ground at the mill in prison. He became the shame of the Israelites under bound in prison of the enemies. He lost his strength, his sight, his glory and  everything.   
- Jug 19:23-25 The Lords of Philistine praised their god for their god has given their enemy Samson into their hands. So their idol gods were glorified. 
-Everyday when Samson lived, he brought shame to God.
-He lost the value of life and not only his strength. God has a purpose when God brought Samson to this world
 
-He lost God as he did not even know God departed from him. 

-In our faith, we have to be careful. Don’t always assume that the holy spirit will abide forever but if we continue to go against God the holy spirit will leave us. 

-Lastly Samson repented and prayed to God to give him another chance. Under his last breath Samson wanted to repay God. 
-Judges 16:28-31 He did not die in sin but he repented and died in glory. 
-He prayed to God to give him the strength one last time and avenged the Philistines.
- The dead he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life time. 
-Finally he did not lose God. That should be our aim that whatever our lives may be we should never lose God.
