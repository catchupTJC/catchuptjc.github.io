-A victorious hymn and is regard to the vision of the appearance of the white horse and was set off and was victorious. 

-We are now at the last days. During the apostolic era they also have been talking about the last day. From the prophesy of the bible are we really at the last days?
- How do we understand the last day from the progression of the kingdoms of the world? 
-Dan 2 It is liken the revelation of the old testament. In Daniel it prophesied a lot of the last days. In chp 2 it tells the different progression of the world until the last days. How many kingdoms have passed?
-Our God talks the history of man, he depict it with a simple picture. This is talking the progression of the kingdom up to the last day with a simple diagram. This is the wisdom of God  to make it simple. 
-God gave a simple dream to the King of Babylon and with this dream very simply God can explain the progression of the kingdoms things that are complicated. 
-Dan 2 :31-35 The dream of the King Babylon
Statue
Head made of pure Gold
Chest and arms of silver
Belly and thigh of bronze
Legs of iron
Feet partly iron partly baked clay
A rock struck the statue on his feet or iron and clay and smashed the statue.
The explanation by Daniel
Dan 2:36-44

-With a simple dream 
The head made of gold is the kingdom of Babylon. It was the  strongest of all kingdoms. You can see the kingdom was strongly protected by wall and the hanging garden is one of the wonders of the world. The wall of Babylon is so thick that you can have 12 chariots lined up side by side to measure the thickness of the wall. 
But based on the prophesy of the bible the kingdom of Babylon was defeated in one night.
Dan 5:30 Overnight the strong kingdom of Babylon fell. It was during the son, Belshazzar had a big feast in his palace and invited all the generals to be with him. 
-At the point of time when the King was having a great feast, they were in the midst of a war. The Persian was already surrounding the wall and the kingdom.
- The King Belshazzar was so proud and was confident that no one can topple down the kingdom that he was having a feast. He was celebrating drinking wine using the holy vessels of God and this defiled God’s holy vessels.
- This is the arrogance of King and those who are proud who did not hold regard of God. 
-So a finger appeared out of nowhere and writing on the walls. No one could interpret it except Daniel. 
-Dan 5:26 God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. This means that his kingdom will be destroyed. 
- You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting
-How did Persia overcome the kingdom of Babylon. The kingdom of Babylon has a deep trench of water into the kingdom. They diverted the water to another part and when it was already dried it was a tunnel into the kingdom. So when they were having a feast at that night, they defeated and the king was slain. That is why we need to respect the word of God and that is why we cannot change the word of god. The word of God will come true. Not a single soul in Babylon can fall overnight. The great kingdom of Babylon was thrown overnight by the kingdom of Persian. 
Why the Persian has 2 hands? Persia and Medes they work together to take down Babylon. The kings of Persia the story of Esther and she was living in the kingdom of Persia. Marathon started from Persian. At the point of time the kingdom of Persian he brought a whole fleet of ships to attack Greek, a very small kingdom but lost. The entire fleet of ships of Persia failed to conquer the small navy ships of Greek. The Greek was so happy that the messenger ran to give the good news to the King of Greek and died of exhaustion. The story of marathon came from this incident to remember the messenger to deliver this good news. 
-After the kingdom of Persia when they lost the war against Greek the Persian fleet went back to Persia. Because he lost this war, they suggested to bring his beautiful queen to come forth to comfort him. This act of summoning the queen is the beginning story of Esther. The Queen Vashthi was very proud and  refused to come to the palace. For the king he felt shame and challenged that he lost his war and his beautiful queen that refused to come out. The rest was not happy that the king can allow the queen to disobey him and should punish the Queen. The King disposed Queen Vashi and chose Esther. 
-After Greece slowly rose in power and replaced kingdom of Persia as the next power house. 
-We know about the King Alexander the Great and he is from Greece.  The highlights of the King Alexander is the 3 mornings and 3 feasts. His father was a victorious general and when he came back after war, Alexander cried. Alexander told his father that he has no other kingdom to conquer. Because you are so capable to conquer so many and at a young age he already had this ambition.
-Alexander riding a white horse and met an old man where is this place? Don’t you know that this is the edge of the world? When Alexander heard this made by the old man he cried. He cried felt empty. I am so young and I have already come to the edge of the world and there is no other land I can conquer? 
-Based on the knowledge of the era they believe there is the edge of the world. He cried. 
-King Alexander was 33 years old he died. He cried for the last time. He has yet to enjoy the splendor of the world. 
-What are the 3 hopes of King Alexander? 
1) when he died he want the best of the physicians to carry his coffin. When he died the greatest physicians was by his side but they could not do anything and therefore they are not fit for anything but to carry his coffin.
2) When he dies, silver money to be thrown on the floor and fresh flowers. Silver is wealth and flowers sign of glory because when he return from victorious war, flowers were strewn. Money and glory that all men would like but at the end of his life, he gave money and glory back as all this is in vain. 
3) The coffin with empty hands shown to be demonstrated to the city. This is to show the King Alexander, I am the great king in this world but when I die, I go empty handed. 

-After the kingdom Greece, the kingdom of roman replaced. Why there are 2 legs. After Caesar died, his kingdom was split into East and West Rome. 

-The progression of the kingdom is as per prophesied by God. The roman dynasty was when Jesus was in. Caesar had a great saying, “Are you in the midst of them?” On the day Caesar was assisinated and saw his own newphew was one of the them that assisinated. How could his newphew he loved but was betrayed by the newphew. The nephew said, I love Caesar but I love Rome even more.  Is this saying the same, I love you Jesus but I love the world more? 
Rome at that time authority might and power. It was sexually immoral and they live by pure money, living with women, authority and influence. That is Rome. I love Caesar I love Rome even more. I love the world even more who is the Caesar my uncle. 
After Rome then come the 10 toes. Referring to the multitude of kingdoms. We are now living in this generations. All the past dynasties, kingdoms have passed. We are now at the last days, after this there is no more. We call it the last days, after this there will be a big stone will shatter this image. 
In every generation will have his own unique, glory and achievements. 
The value of the kingdom depreciate from kingdom to kingdom from gold, silver, bronze, iron part clay. 
-Today even value of  money has depreciated as few cents can no longer even buy anything. 
-Gold (the heaviest) , silver, bronze and toes is part clay. This world will fall anytime. Here the head is the heaviest and anytime this image can fall anytime. The feet is a mix of hard clay and metal. If you invest your life in this world it will fall anytime. This world, kingdom will fall. Value will keep on dropping. 
Dan 2:31 How did God reveal the times of this world. 
This structure was very tall. The kings of this world are aragont and great in their times. The kings were only be more and more arrogant. The splendor was excellent. This world is alluring and filled with splendor. This is the external appearance. 
Dan 2:31 The form was awesome. The form of this world is awesome and scary. 
Dan 7
Depict 4 beasts which are  Babylon, Persia, Greek, Rome. The interpretation of these beasts. 
Dan 7:3, 6,7. Every one of the beasts represent the 4 kingdom. The kingdom of Babylon is the lion with eagle wings. The lion with wings. Persia is a bear. Greece is a leapord. Leapord is the fastest animal and yet has 4 wings of the bird. So it is really fast conquerer. The speed king Alexander conquer the world is like this beast leapord with wings. I come I conquer. Greece attacking like the speed of the leapord with 4 wings. The bible described this kingdoms as beasts. The world is the nest of the unclean spirits. 
We have explained the progression of the kingdom and the downfall. 
In the last days how God will establish the eternal kingdom. 

-Before the world destroyed, God will set an eternal kingdom. 

-Dan 2:44-45 Is there any kingdom that is eternal? Only the kingdom of God will have a kingdom where it cannot be destroyed. This is when the true church will be established. 
The ancient times, they did not know what will happen next 
The true church will not be destroyed as the word of God will be eternal. The church of God is the life of God and the word of God and the life of God wll be eternal.
2) This kingdom will not be left by other people. This kingdom does not belong to the people. 
Num 23:9 The kingdom will not be left to other people and the true church is not the same with other churches and it is unique. If we want to enter the kingdom of god, they have to come to the church. We are separated and cannot mix and reckon with other people. How to talk about the baptism, Sabbath etc they will not agree with you. What is separating us from the other secular churches. It is the truth that separates from TJC and other churches. This is the second point that we are not listed with other nations. 
3) We will break through. In the last days, the church does not belong to the world. The true church in opposition with the world and in opposition with Satan. We will not give to the devil and if you want to be children of God you need to keep the commands and do according what God commands. This is our gospel and the gospel that saves and it is also judgement. When we preach but they reject it and at the end of the day, the word of God will judge him. 
-Jesus believe and baptized and you will be saved. After that Those who do not believe will be condemn because you do not believe in the baptism that forgives sin. It is not us to judge but the word of God will judge them. 
-In the day of judgement , it is the word of god that will judge us. Jn 12: 47-48
Jesus says I am here to save you. If anyone hears my words and does not keep them I do not judge them for I come to save the world. For the one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge and the world of God will judge him on the last day. 
It is important to pray that those we preach will be humble to accept the gospel of salvation. 
-From the progression of all the kingdoms we are at the last day. 

-Mt 13: All these parables the church will progress and on the last day
1st parable – the parable of the sower.  
The kingdom of heaven is the sower sowed seeds and seeds fell on the different souls. 
The church will start at Mt 13:24-25. 
Jesus the kingdom of heaven is like a sowed seeds is when Jesus and apostles started preaching. The good seed has been sowed during Jesus time. The church has not been established. The church was established in Acts 2. The whole plan of God starts from Mt 13:24 onwards ie the parable of the wheats and weeds. So during the apostles time was preaching Satan already started to sowed weeds. From the epistles of Paul and peter some of the church started to change. When the apostles still alive the church started to weaken and change. Paul heard the church of Galatia it is astonishing to me why you have changed so quickly. When the apostles alive, heresies started to come in. The church started to degrade overtime. 
The parable of the mustard seed. – This is the time of the Roman Catholic. This small seed grew a big tree. A mustard seed no matter how it grow is a plant but this mustard seed grew a big tree. It has changed. The Roman Catholics always insists that they are the continuation of the apostles church. From the past until the Roman Catholic, there were only one church and no other sects. They are called the Catholics because they are the general Christian faith for the masses. During that period of time there is only one church which is the Catholic church. After Elder John died in patmos island, they started to have popes to replace these apostles. The church started to change. In the past apostles known as servant of god but now crown as pope. The church started deviate and degrade and they became the Roman Catholics. 
The pope is a representative of Jesus and can overight the word of Jesus. 
When you look at the parable of the mustard seed it was at the period of time of Roman Catholic where it became a big tree and birds flocked.

-During the time of Martin luther, the kingdom of heaven is flour became leaven. After the roman catholic church era and degraded a reformation is needed. The catholic church were greedy for money. Salvation can be purchased with money. If you have sinned , you go for a sum money and the priest will pray for your forgiveness. To have redemption and you need to buy some documents or ministers, known as indulgence. This is historical facts. The church has changed so much that it became a money organization where the poor cannot go to the kingdom of God. There were still many believe these churches for 100 over years. 
Martin Luther reformed the church and wrote a list of 95 grave mistakes of the Roman Catholic. Because of one person all over the world fight against the pope. 
-Like a leaven it flourish and  many churches, sects started to be established. There are 3000 plusdifferent denominations last 25 years ago. Mt 24:33  It is so hard for Christians to find the truth. It became a form of delusion. People started to mock Christianity with one bible so many denominations. Out of the few thousands, TJC said only true church that can save and no one will believe. 
-go back the beginning there is one church. 
Parable of the Yeast
The woman 3 measure of yeast and work through the dough.

-Mt 13: 44
After the degration of the church the holy spirit. After parable of leaven, Jesus started to explain the parable of the tares, he continued to say the parable of the treasures. After the church degraded, God will establish a new church.
-Mt 13:44-46 The true church has been established. The ch is like a hidden treasure . Pearl is reference the holy spirit in the true church. It is those who search of the truth and the holy spirit will find it. The person who knows the value of the truth and the holy spirit will sell everything they have to get the truth and holy spirit (pearl) 
-When others come to TJC, they only see the appearance of the building instead of the truth and holy spirit. 
Witnessing. 
A member in secular church was disappointed with the TJC as there was only a few members. He then realized based on the number of the count, there was angels in the midst of the congregation! Praise God. 
-Even Jesus when he came he was lowly, he was the son of the carpenter, came from Nazareth and his disposition is not handsome. When Jesus suffered, the soldiers mocked him. His origin, his background he was nothing. 
-The tabernacle was made up from the skin of animals which is dark in colour. The tabernacle is dark skinned and not captivating. Walk into the tabernacle, you will see laid with gold and beautiful crafted vessels. 
-When you bring friends, what do you want them to see. You do not want them to see the exterior of the buildings, but what is important to bring them to Jesus Christ, to see the pearl, the holy spirit and the truth.

-TJC has been established for 100 years. 

-Mt 13: 47-48 The kingdom of God is the last parable ie the parable of the dragnet. We are now in the last days of this parable. The kingdom of heaven is catching fishes. 
Mt 13: 48 When it is full, when they draw this net to the shore, the last days will come. The door of salvation is closed when it is full. The number has been filled. There is a fix number is filled and everything will end. 
-We have no time left. Mt 13:48 states when it is full and that time, the door of salvation will be closed. When we talk about the end of time, the door of salvation will be closed and the true church will not be there anymore. 
-Mt 13;44,45,47   Now is nearer to the end. The church in phase 2 when the true church is established and holy spirit working. 
When they draw the net to shore, there is a second choosing. 
When Jesus chose us there is 2 round of choosing. When is the first time choose you. When you accept the gospel you have been chosen the first time. The second choosing when the net being drawn and there would be a separation of good and evil. The choosing will be in TJC. The first round of choosing in the world. The second round of choosing is in church. 
Mt 13: 49 The kingdom of God is for the people of the just. The true church is the church for the just. From among the just people God will separate the wicked. This is not the one time calling. The first choosing when you are chosen from the world and the second choosing is when you ar ein church. 
-Some people have turned wicked in the church. They oppose the truth. Jesus kept them there. Jesus allowed them to live with the righteous. On the last day, second choosing the wicked will be separated from the just. 
-Many believers do not know about the second choosing. These are the tares amongst the wheats. 
-Mt 13:41 The kingdom of God, there are those people who offend, causes the believers to fall and deviate of the truth and practice lawlessness. There are leaders who tell members to deviate the members from the truth and causing people to fall. 

-The 3 main era that church will experience
The 1st period which is a 1000 year period is the time when the appearance of the TJC. Starts from 1917. This 1000 year period we will reign with God. 
During this time the 1st thing you see is the appearance of the white horse and the forehead sealed. During this time, the Devil will be bound. 
-After this 1000 year 1st period, the 2nd period, it will be the period of trampling. This is the time, the church will be stepped on by the evil force and this is the time the church will be persecuted. The servants of God being killed. This are things in the period of trampling. 
-After that the church will move the 3rd period. The period of exposure where the servants of church will be slain and the bodies of the servants of God will be laid in the open for 3.5 days.  This 3rd period, the door of salvation will be closed. The divine work, preaching will stop at this time. 
-After this 3.5 days of corpse exposure it was the time church will be uplifted. 
-In the past, the church will go through the tribulations together with the people of the world and after that those saved will be uplifted. 

-The church uplifted up after the 3.5 days corpse were exposure. After the church uplifted the church will not face all the tribulations and that is the time, God will really punish the people of the world. These 7 bowls recorded in the Revelation is given to the people of the world. This cup of wrath the church will not face. God will keep us. Before the great tribulations, the church will be lifted up. 

From appearance of the church is known as the 1000 year period. This is the time, we still pray for holy spirit and sealed by the holy spirit and preaching is done. Very quickly 2nd phase the church will be persecuated and the door of salvation will close. After the 3 periods, the church will be uplifted. After the church uplifted in heavens, the people of lawlessness and of the world will face the 7 bowls in revelation. 
The difference compared to the traditional explanation is when the church is uplifted. 

-The beginning of the church of the 1000 period is when the true church is established. 
Rev 20: 4-6 Those resurrected with Christ . This is the 1st resurrection refers to baptism when we are baptized and are resurrected with Christ.  This work of allowing other people to experience the 1st resurrection and preaching will happen in the 1000 period. 
-The first death is referring when Adam partake the fruit  of good and knowledge and all mankind sin and death. 
-The second death is when judgement comes when they will suffer in the lake of fire. 

Rev 20:14-15 The 1st death is when Adam sin and the 2nd death is the eternal death when they are cast in the lake of fire. 
-Rev 20:6 Those who experience the 1st resurrection, the second death has no power over them. That is why baptism is very important. Those in the hospital almost dying so that they can be resurrected for the 1st time and the second death has no power over them. 
-The first resurrection is so important to protect them the second death. God reveal to the apostles. 
-This can only happen during the period of 1000 years.  When we preach and bringing the 1st resurrection to others. 

-Rev 6:1-2 This is the beginning of the true church when the 1st seal is opened. The one who sat on the white horse is when the gospel is spread. This time is the spiritual battle when the church needs to fight a spiritual battle with the Devil and also a spiritual battle fighting against ourselves, our own desires, pride, lust of flesh etc. 
-Paul in the book Corinthians paul had to fight against his own spiritual battle. If we don’t go to the battle fight how can we be victorious. This is the appearance of the white house. 

-Next is the period of seal. This is the period of us receiving the seal of the holy spirit. Before the destruction of the earth, the angel from the rising sun, he stopped the angel until wait I seal all the servants of God. 
-This 1000 period of time when the people of God is being sealed with the holy spirit. 
-Rev 7:1-4 This is the period of angel sealing. Then I sawn another angel coming up from the east having the seal of the living god. He called out in a loud voice ot ht efour angels who had given power to harm the land and the sea. Do not h arm the land of the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the forehead sof the servant os fhte God. 

-The angel from the east, refers to the church rising from the east. The angel is the servant of god. And the church is liken as the angel of the East. The church will rise and will ensure the people of God will be sealed with the holy spirit. The church will seal those who pray to be sealed with the holy spirit. 

-The 144k are sealed and this is just a symbolic figure. This is perfect number whereby 12Kx12K. This is the time we need to pray hard for the holy spirit. After all the seal has been sealed then during thi 1000 period. This is also the time to preach. 

-Rev 11: 3-6 these 2 witnesses refers to all the servants of  God preaching in the world. When they go out to preach, god is with them. If anyone who tries to harm them, fire will proceed fromt heir mouth. From the mouth of Jesus will be sword. The word of god is like fire of god to purify us so that we can be pure. The fire of god is also a form of judgment that those who cannot believe. The homosexual is now accepted in the world but the preachers will preach against this like fire out from their mouth. The fire preceeding from te mouth of these 2 witnesses, many wanted to kill them. 
-During 1000 period other than receiving the seal of the holy spirit, and preaching, the devil will be bounded for 1000 years. 

-Rev 20:1-3Angel coming down from heaven having he key to bound devil for a 1000 years. Satan is kept in the Abyss for 1000 years. To keep him deceiving the ntations until 1000 years willend. 
Because this devil is bounded we can preach and after 1000 years fulfilled, the devil will be released from its chain. 
When the devil released, the first thing the devil will do.
Rev 20:7-10 1st thing that the devil did released from the 1000 bondage to go to the world to deceive the people and to incite the war of Armegeddon. They will surround the camp of the saints which is the true church. The city is referring to the church. The first thing he will deceive the nations and attack the church. 
-1000 period this is the 4 things that will happen. 
-if devil bounded how is it still there is work of the devil during this 1000 period. 
-We need to understand the purpose of binding the devil. 
-The purpose of bounding the devil that he cannot deceive the nations to incite war. So other than that purpose he can do all other work. 
-This is the time God does not allow it and Satan cannot have the power to do that. That is why the devil has been bounded.  
-Rev 20: 8 the moment devil is bound, he deceived the nations and incite war against the camp of god’s people.
-Eg fugitive can only be within the boundary although he can do what he wants. 
-The seal set on the devil that there is restrictions not exceeding what has been set by God that he cannot deceive and incite all the nations. 
-The devil is also working during this 1000 year period but not in global scale where it can work with the nations. The moment devil released this deception will be great. If you do not hold fast to the faith, you can be deceived. 
-We are now in 1000 period. 

-2nd period will be a period of trampling. 
Rev 11:1-2 The holy spirit will be trampled underfoot for 42 months. Before the holy city being trampled God wants us to rise up and measure the temple of god. With the word of God to measure our faith, our conduct our church whether we are up to god’s standard. To measure the truth whether it is still measuring to god’s standard. Did we lose anything? We have to rise to measure the altar. To measure our relationship with God . Our worship and sacrifices to God. Measure whether our conduct with the measure of God. The blue print of the temple has 4 boxes . 
Outside the temple box is the whole area of the holy temple. The holy temple is divided 4 sections. 
1) Gentiles court. The gentile can come to the gentile to court to worship. God accept the gentiles to worship him. 
2) Inner court – the court of the Israelites and gentiles cannot enter this court of Israelites or they will be stoned. There is a temple guard and have the power to cast you out. 
3) Court of levites or the court of priests even the Israelites cannot go in except the priests and levites as they live there and only them they can enter this court. Even Jesus and the disciples cannot enter this court of levites. Jesus and disciples only happen in the court of Israelites which is the second court. 
4) holy temple – This is the inner most of the 4 sections. In this holy temple is separated into 2 sections which is holy of holies. In the holy temple 3 items, incense, the table of shrewbread and altar. In the holy of holies, the ark of covenant is there. When rev 11: 1 to measure the temple is to measure the holy temple. When God measures the inner temple but anyone out from this holy temple will be disregarded. No need to measure for outside the temple as they are considered as gentiles. 

-	We members we must strive to enter the holy temple, cannot come as a guest, a gentile, levite but to go to holy of holies. 
-	When you come to church as truth seeker, come to church to listen, then beliver like Israelites just come ot church and listen to sermon only, then when we start serving god, zealous for god then they are like levite and priests. Then after serving god if they have establish the relationship of god to the holy of holies. if we are in the holy temple that is when we are measured. Many members may be just the court of the Israelites, or just at levite & priests. We have to work hard to strive to enter the holy of holies. Measured only those in the holy temple and is counted and those outside the holy temple will not be measured and is disregarded. 
-	When the time comes, if we still remain the outer court, and God will take us as gentiles. All this is to prepare the period of trampling. 
-	After the period of trampling the body of the servants of god will be exposed. ‘
Rev 11:7-10The 2 witness will be killed by the demon relased from the bottomless pit. This is the period of mocking and other nations will start to mock the church. The corpses will not be allowed to put in the grave and have a burial. They would want to tear to pieces. 
Rev 11:10 When the 2 witnesses died the faitful servant killed and they were happy. These 2 witnesses tormented to these people of the world. Vs 5 fire proceeded from the mouth to the people of the world. The fire is the word of God to rebuke the people of the world. John the Baptist died was beheaded because he told king herod to marry the brother’s wife. King herod was angry as he was king and should not be reprimanded in public. He dare not lay a hand for others regard him as prophet. But the daughter of the wife because she danced well before the king and promised to give him anything up to half of the kingdom on his birthday. This girl only wanted the head of John the Baptist on the platter. John the Baptist exposed his shame. 

-The people who focus of the world is the people of the world. The people who focus heaven then people of God. 
It is the people who dwells on earth and are the world and kill the witnesses.
 To kill witnesses to eliminate the preachers can also be discarded by CMC etc as they don’t like the preacher to expose the shame of the church. 

-In the church of God, when the mindset sets of the world. They lead the church the methods of the church instead the way of God. 

-Period of trampling when the rights of the people of God will be taken out. 
-Dan 12:7 When the church will be persecuted? When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, shattered  all these things wil be completed. 

-This period of trampling known as period of gentiles, the people of the mindset of the world will bring harm to the people of God. 

3)The period of exposure
This period of exposure all the corpse exposed. All the gospel stopped and no longer hear the gospel of God as all the servants of God will be killed. When you come to TJC and those trampled. Those who in church are carnal and of the flesh. Period of shame. The faithful of God will be killed. The word of God can no longer be heard. 

-Rev 15: 7-8 The 7 bowls are full the wrath of God is God meting out his punishment. Before the 7 bowls the temple will be closed. The temple filled with the glory of God and no one can enter the temple. For those who left cannot come in. To enter the temple of God, don’t wait until the temple door is closed. 
-That is the most crucial period. Did the witnesses refers the church. The witnesses resurrected. 

-Rev 11:11-14 After 3.5 days, the witnesses, ie the church was resurrected.  This is the most glorious time of the church. The last work will eventually be revived and be raised. The true church, true members, will be killed, will be mocked, trampled,  exposed, will be raised. 

-the 7 bowls is for the people of the world, the wicked people who are not saved. 

-God has promised before the persecution , God will take away so that we will not be persecuted. Prior to this, we have been persecuted so that we will not need experience the 2nd persecution. 

-Rev 3:10 Jesus promised the members of Philadelphia that since he has endured patiently , Jesus will keep them from the hour of trial 

-Rev 14:9-10 The 7 bowls talks about the wrath of god. Drink o wine of God’s fury and the cup of God’s wrath. This talks about the fury of God and there is no hint of mercy, love or grace. It is a 100% pure fury of God. 

-The wine of wrath to the mark of the beasts and has nothing to do the people of God. The 7 bowls is terrible. So when the witnesses raised on earth the last day has not come yet. When we are raised, the remaining people . 
Rev 11:12 The church was raised. 
Rev 11:13 After the church was raised, there was a big earthquake, 7000 died but it is not the last days yet. 
There are still remnants, and they start to be afraid. 
Rev 11: 14  Whatever we can see after the church raised, the calamities will happen and then the bowls will befall. 

-1 Thess 4:16-17 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, Those who are dead in Christ will rise first. For those alive and are let will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air. 

-During this time, the last day has not come yet.  
When we are alive how do we raised when we are still alive. 

-1 Cor 15:50-54 Our corruptible bodies will be changed to uncorruptible. It changed in moment of twinking of the eye the trumpet will sound and we will be changed. The people left on earth will be changed and are not dead. 
When talking the resurrection of the physical body. The resurrection is concerning soul as soul cannot die. This also refers to the physical body too. The resurrection including the body eg like Lazarus. 

-The person resurrection to physical body and then in a twinking will be transformed to spiritual body. Jesus resurrected he was with physical body and could not found the body as it was resurrected. The resurrected body is transformed as spiritual body. How we resurrect is like Jesus resurrect. We will resurrect in physical body and in twinkling body transformed to spiritual body. 

-Rom 8;11 Give life to the mortal bodies thorough his spirit
 who lives in you. 

-You have to be prepared on these 3 periods 
1) Period of 1000 years
2) Period of trampling
3) Period of exposure 

-Rev 6:11 The lord asked them to wait a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and brother who were killed as they have been was completed. 

-This little while longer will be followed by other disasters in the 7 bowls. 

-Rev 12;14 the woman given 2 wings of a great eagle where she should be taken care for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent reach. You think you have a lot of time but in actual fact it is very short. 

-Rev 8:1 He opened the 7th seal there was a silence in heaven for about half an hour. There was a change of ambience as the 7th seal where there is a manifestation of God’s fury. 

-Rev 6: 15=17 When the 7th seal opened the wrath of the Lamb is only towards for the people of the world and lawlessness but for the people of God we have been raised to heaven and have been uplifted. 

-Rev 11:13 The remnant when the Israelites repented. The witness resurrected then the earthquake came and the remnants which are the tares, 7000 killed, hidden tares died in the earthquake. 
2 sets 7000  is the existing tares and goats in the church. The rest as the people of Israel and only then they were afraid and accepted Christ and give glory to God. The Israelites belive during the ascension. 

-The salvation of the Israelites. 
Rom 11:25 until the fullness of the gentiles then all the Israelites will be saved. 
This is the mystery. Heart of the Israelites has been hardened. When the gentiles number is fulfilled, then Israelites will turn back. 
2nd sign – all Israelites will believe in Christ. All doesn’t mean all but only the remnants ie only those who have not died yet. Where are the rest of the Israelites they were killed in the war. Then only they repented and believe in Jesus. One day Israelites 1/3 killed and they repented and God will save them as they believe in the Messiah. 
Rom 9:27 only remnant of Israelites will be saved. 

-Zech 13: 7-9 This is the prophesy concerning the Israelites. 
Israelites 2/3 will die in battle and the remnant of 1/3 will refine them with fire and they shall call the name of God. The name of God is Jesus.
