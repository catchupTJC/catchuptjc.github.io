There are 4 stages of the salvation plan of God
1) Jesus came in the flesh to die for sinners
2) The downpour of the holy spirit working mightily
3) After church purified and lifted up. 

Eph 1:3-5
1 Tim 3: 16
Acts 1:8
-The second phase 2 of the Salvation of God is to establish the church of God. 

-Phase 3 is the climax of the salvation plan. What is this phase that we are in? Now the church has been established and the holy spirit has established the church. The TJC has been established all over the world. Phase 3 will be completed when the church is lifted up in heaven. Then the entire salvation plan can be completed. 
1 Thess 4:16-18 Satan will do everything to prevent the church from lifted up and try their best to defile the true church, to weaken the church and make sure the truth is deviated. If the church cannot be lifted up then the salvation plan cannot be completed. 
-If the church cannot be lifted up, then Jesus death will be in vain and the establishment of all the churches will be also in vain. 
-At the last day, the holy spirit will work mightily so that the church can be completed and lifted up in heavens. 
-We always think the salvation plan is complete but it is still not as the only salvation plan in phase 1 is completed  when Jesus died on the cross to save sinners. 
-Here only Jesus can fill this role as he is the only sinless man and no one can fulfill this salvation plan. 
-This is why God himself has to come down from heaven to fulfill this salvation plan. 
-The second phase is when Holy spirit was sent  to establish the church. 
-From the year of 1917 when TJC was established right until now,  we have been establishing churches from the power of  God from the holy spirit. The holy spirit is the most important part in establishing the church. Without the holy spirit everything is in vain. 
-The Satan will try their best to attack to ensure this doesnâ€™t happen.  
-In phase 3 the churches will be lifted up and the salvation plan will be completed. This is the living hope and faith we have that we will be lifted up. 
-If the church of God cannot be lifted up in heaven, the salvation plan will fail. God will not allow this as  God will not allow this to fail. 
-In this part, the conflict between God and the devil will be even more intense. 
-Today, we live in blessings and we are lukewarm . Sometimes when we hear harsh sermons then we cannot take it. If we cannot be perfect how can the church be lifted up? 
-Every child of God must partake in this part so that we can be purified and taken up to heaven. Only when we partake in this salvation plan then can we be purified and sanctified.

Summary
1) Original phase the downfall of the apostolic church and the establishment of the true church.
2) The downpour of the holy spirit in Acts 2 to establish the apostolic church. After that 100 over years since the apostolic church downfall, the truth deviated and the holy spirit left. 
3) In 1917 the true church has been established. The church in Acts was destroyed once in the past when all the apostles died and the truth deviated. At the last day, God re-established the true church in TJC. 
-The TJC today is an exact the replica of the apostolic church that has been established. Whatever we believe and everything we do is what the apostolic church has been doing in the past. We are the revival of the apostolic church. 
-The only question is how can the TJC preach to the Jews so that the Israelites cab be saved?
-However during the establishment of the apostolic church, it was the Jews that were the first one to believe. The apostolic church started when the downpour of the holy spirit and during the period of time, it was the Jews that first believe. 
-They believe in the establishment of one true God, Sabbath day, baptism, foot washing etc. If they can accept the true gospel then, he can allow the Jews to believe. We just need to believe in the words of God and this is the plan that has been set since the Genesis the beginning of time. 
Now we are in phase 2 that is by the holy spirit we are establishing the churches and very soon the church will be lifted up in heaven.
