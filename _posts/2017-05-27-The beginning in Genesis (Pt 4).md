-Gen Chp 1 is pertaining to creation. 
-In the creation, is each day is 24 hours or is it longer than that? Some explained that 1 day is about 1000 years. This is to explain why the earth is million years old found scientifically. 
-The bible clearly states that 1 day is 24 hours. 
-Gen 1:5God called the light Day and the darkness night . And there was evening and there was morning the first day.
-Another proof is when Moses instructed the people to observe the Sabbath day. He said that God created in 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. 
-Ex 20: 10-11 But the seventh day is a Sabbath ot the Lord your God . vs 11 For in 6 days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. 
-When God created the plants, he already made the full grown plant with fruits and seed in it. When God created Adam he created Adam as an adult. Whatever God created is full grown and has already matured. The question which comes first chicken or egg and the answer is definitely chicken first!
-1st day God created light. 
-Wnd day god created air
-3rd day God created trees, plants
-4th day God created stars,moon, sun
-5th day God created birds in the air and fishes 
-6th day God created animals & men. 
These are the preparations made by God.
The 1st day God created light to give light to the sun, moon, stars. The 2nd day God separated the waters to create air and the 3rd day separated the land, sea, rivers and plantation to prepare for the creation on the 5th and 6th day ie the birds, fishes and animals and men. 
-So you can know from his 6 days of creation this is the God who prepares and provides. 
-God prepared the Garden of Eden then he created man and woman and put them in this Garden. 
-Before God destroyed the world with water, God already prepared an ark for them. However they failed to enter the ark except for the family of Noah.
-God prepared a salvation path, a way of kingdom of heaven for us and has prepared a place in heaven for us. 
-So let us worry, be anxious knowing that the God we worship is a God who prepares and provides. 
-The creation of 6 days is a creation of rebirth. 
-The reborn person must accept and receive light, which is Jesus Christ. If we do not accept light we will still live in darkenss. Jesus said I am the light of the world but the people of the world did not want to accept the light. 
-Jn 8:12 I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.
-Jn 1:5 Theh light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. 
Jn 1:9, 10-11 The true light, which enlightens everyone ws coming into the world. He was in the world and the world was made through him yet the world did not know him. He came to his own and his won people did not receive him. 
 
-If we want to be reborn, we need to first accept the light, which is our Lord Jesus Christ. If we do not accept Jesus, we will live in darkness. The first thing we need to receive the light and truth. 
2nd day â€“ The water will be separated with air and there is water below and water above . 
Once you are reborn, you have to separate yourself from good and evil. You must separate yourself whether you belong to heaven or earth. 
-Phil 3: 20-21 But our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await a savior the lord jesus Christ who will transform our lowly body to be like  his glorious body by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. 
-Col 3:1-3 If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of god . Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God . 
-Once you accepted Jesus Christ, you must be separated and belong above and in heaven through your conduct, your speech etc. Although you are reborn, our actions  and walk accordance those minds set above and of God. 
-On the 3rd day
Once we are separated, we will bear fruits with seeds. If we cannot bear fruits is because we have not separated from heaven and earth. If we belong and born of Christ, we should bear fruits. 
-Mt 3:8 Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Lord Jesus has said that those who does not bear fruit will be cut down. 
-4th day is sun, moon, stars 
So on the 4th day, whether day or night, there will be light. A person can only shine only when they bear fruits. So you need to bear fruits of the holy spirit love, joy, peace etc only then we can shine. 
-5th day. 
Once we shine, our lives will enter the 5th day. Our life will be like birds of the air and fishes of the sea. 
-The birds of the air will most of the time in the air. When they are hungry they will go down to the earth but will quickly fly up and rest on the tree. The bird has transcended above overcoming the world. The bird is singing on the trees living in joy and the life is free without burdens. 
-Those reborn we need to have a life transcend above things of the world and have a life of joy and freedom from the crutches of the world. 
-The life in the sea. Sea is salty and cannot be drunk. The fish lives in the sea all their lifetime but the flesh of the fish is not salty. In the world there is a lot of sins, promiscuity but the sins does not affect the reborn as they are still able to be holy and not affected. The fish although live in the salty sea yet the flesh is not affected. 
-So the man who separate himself and is of above, has received the light, bears fruits and will live like the birds of the air and fishes in the sea. Their life will then be full of joy and are not corrupted by the sins of the word. 
-6th day
God created animals, man and woman. The creation of men is the most glorious as it is created in the image of God. God created man by dust and there is no value. After God created out of his image and glory, man should live in a glorious way. In men, they have the image of God which is the highest peak of creation.  
-After we reborn, we have to live a glorious image of Jesus Christ. No matter where we are, people can see the image, glory of Jesus in us. 
-Day 1 to day 6 the creation also can tell us the glorious creation. 
-Why God created animals together with the men on the 6th day?
-If we do not have the image of God, live without the teachings of God, then we are liken like animals. Humans are separated from animals as we have the image of God. 
-if we do not have the image of God, then we are no different from animals. Animals and men are created by dust the same material. So what is the difference? When God created human He created them in the image of God and not the animals. 
-If the image of God, the glory of God is gone then there is no difference between men and animals. Some human without God, act worst than animals as some animals/mammals will protect their young etc. 
-Therefore it is important that men realized and value that we need to have the image of God, the glory of God to be reborn and to belong in the kingdom of God. 
  
From this 6 days creation we can learn the teachings and a reminder for all of us to be reborn in the Lord. 
-Everyday God said it is good except the 2nd day. On the second day separated the waters with air. Why? 
Gen 7 God knows that the water above the air will be poured down on earth and this was not good. Flood will be used to destroy the world. God created men not to destroy them but to save them but the great sin of men was too great. 
-The second reason was of the evil spirit will contaminate the world. In the air there was evil.  
-Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rules against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. 
-When we murmur too much we have not reborn from day 1 to 6. The Christians in the last day needs to spiritual nurture themselves. It is not just concentrate on divine work. We have not departed from truth, we baptize in the lord, we have the holy spirit, we have come to church, the only thing that is lacking is to spiritual nurture ourselves that is to bear fruits, to shine and live a glorious life for Jesus. 
-The last chapter of Revelation is to wash our garments. Our garment is stained and we need to spiritual nurture ourselves. To overcome lies, pride, temper, jealousy, hate etc. 
-As divine workers we must need to have the spiritual nurture and is more important than doing divine work.
