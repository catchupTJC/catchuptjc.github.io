-John 18: 37-38
-John 16: 13
-God will guide us in the form of the spirit of truth if we are willing to let Him into our hearts

-To do that, we will have to first humble ourselves and repent before the Lord.
The true work is to guide us into the truth.

-The truth is the word of God and there are many characteristics to it:
1) The truth doesn’t change – it is timeless
Philosophies and theories are being discovered/changed over time however, that isn’t the case with the word of God

-Hebrews 13: 8
-Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
-We can only place our trust in someone who’s words never change – so much so that there is no room for unrighteousness.

-If a person promises to be faithful up to 99.9%, the small margin for doubt thus still exists and that itself is sufficient to taint the genuineness of the that person’s faith

-We have to fully entrust our faith, there is no meeting mid-way.

-2 Tim 2: 13
-God cannot disown himself.
-It is a tendency for man to be unable to fulfill their words even when the try their best at times – how many times are we disappointed with words like “I’m sorry that I couldn’t..”

-God can’t deny Himself for He is the truth

2) The truth concerning everything
-Philosophers and scientist are in search for things that we lack understanding of this world.

-The Lord’s teachings are stated outright and are eternal. It brings to us the understanding of the purpose of man.

3) The truth will set you free
-John 8: 32-34
-Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free

-All of us are slaves to sin. Are we able to declare ourselves unblemished and free of sin?

-Now there are some people who are understanding of the truth but defer their acceptance of the Lord because of the lack of freedom that entails

-Does having the freedom to gamble and drink a sign of being truly free?
-We are only deceiving ourselves for these bad habits will lead us to being chained to those obsessions.

-Believing in omens and superstitions also deprives us from freedom – wedding dates, etc

-In Christ we have nothing to fear for everyday we are under His guidance and protection – it will set us free

-Conclusion:
-When we compare the truth, the words of man is always changing (broken promises and aren’t able to withstand the test of time)

-The word of the Lord is eternal and will forever remain
