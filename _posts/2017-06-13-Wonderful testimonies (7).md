-Today our presence of miracles has lessened. This may be due to our emphasis may be just on activities and have not pay much emphasis on the day of atonement & repentance. 
-This miracle is about someone who was carried in but able to walk out. This is a miracle of a lame person. 
-Mk 2: 3, 11-12
-This miracle happened to a successful rich woman. She was a career woman and at the age 39-40 she was diagnosed with last stage of cancer. 
-She was disappointed as she was still young. She graduated from college about about 20 something and when she is at the peak of her career and she has achieved much success and wealth, she is going to die. 
-She was an atheist but because she wanted to be cured, she went to many temples, spent a lot of money there but there is still no change. 
-Someone told her why don’t you believe in Jesus to heal you. So near her house, there was a church. 4 person carried her to the nearby church and ask the pastor, “Can Jesus heal her?”. The pastor did not answer her question but told her if you believe in Jesus, your soul shall be saved. 
-But to this sick lady, she wanted to be healed first and it is not for salvation. 
-The members of the family who carried her was disappointed and brought her back. They all lost hope as they have gone to temple and church but with no avail. 
-The neighbour who asked her to believe in Jesus asked her why did she not go to church? She said she did go to the church nearby but the pastor in that Jesus said Jesus can only save souls and was not able to heal her. 
-The neighbour said that she forgot to tell her that she should go to True Jesus church whereby there are many signs and miracles. 
-Although it was far,  her family members still took her to church and in front of the gate and asked the same question, “Can she be healed?”. They did not say much and told her that the members and the whole church will pray for her. So they prayed  before and after service. They prayed for her in Jesus’ name. For 3 hours, she was not tired. Slowly she could sit up from lying down. Then she could kneel down and she continued to praise God. After that she could walk out and was hungry. She ate 3 bowls of noodles. 
-The family members wanted to carry her back, but she said that Jesus has healed her and will walk with them. 
-The people lived near the True Jesus Church and actually respected the church as they themselves have seen many signs and miracles that has happened. 

2) This happened in 2003. When the child fell from the 10th floor and she was 17 years old at that time. When the mother saw that her child fell, she fainted at the 10th floor. The pedestrians discovered the child was unconscious and took her to the hospital. In the hospital, the doctor told the family members that she had a concussion. 3 things may happen
a) Although the child is alive, the child may die soon. 
b) The child will become a vegetable if he doesn’t die
c) sHe will need a lot of  money for surgery to have an operation. 
The doctor is waiting for the family members to bring the money. In the meanwhile, they pushed the patient to the side of the alley in the hospital and just put her in drips and left her alone waiting for her parents to bring the money.
- The child did not die and was still breathing but was on drip. For 2 days, the child was on drip. The family members did not have the money and dare not go to the hospital. They could only pray and ask the church members to pray for their child. They were hoping the doctor would do the surgery even though the money did not come. After 4 days, they asked church minister and church members to accompany them thinking that they go to the hospital to collect a corpse.

But miraculously, the boy on the 4th day, could sit up and said he was hungry. When the nurse saw this, she was so surprised and screamed thinking the boy was a ghost. At that time the doctor and nurses gathered around the boy. It was at this time,  the family members arrived. The boy say the parents and told them that  he was hungry and wanted to go home. The family member and ministers praised God loudly  “Hallelujah” . The church and the members continued to pray for this boy during his stay in the hospital and indeed God has heard the prayers and healed the boy. 
Phil 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication and the peace of God which passed all understand will keep your hearts and minds through Christ. 
Truly this is the mercy of God and our lives are indeed in the hands of God. 

3rd Miracle: The chastisement and salvation of God
There is husband and wife to go out to the sea to collect seaweed. In the middle of the sea the boat overturned. They manage to hold on to the boat for a day. In the mid day the sun was shinning and at night they were in total darkness. During this time, they continued to pray in repentance. They told God if you save us, we will observe Sabbath, go to church often, serve God. While they were praying they went through the night till dawn. They are so tired and not so conscious as they were on and off sleep. Then they heard a voice calling them and saw a big ship right in front. They keep on praising God and thank them for saving them. The person in the ship said that they were having engine trouble and the ship drifted and drifted near them. They did not come to save them but somehow the ship drifted near them. The husband and wife realized that this is a chastisement from God. They repented and told each other that they will be diligent in going to church services and to serve God as they were spiritually weak in the past.
-Heb 12:11

4th  Miracle
Ps 42:5, 11 
-We often feel sad. The bible always encourage us not to be dismayed but to look upon God. God will take away our worries and burdens. God will help us in a smiling countenance. 
-We have a sister who is a church member who married a gentile. The husband lived in a big family and the house is filled with the husband’s family members. Even then, she still felt lonely. She knew of a sister and always like to go to church. But the family members doesn’t like her to go to church and had to go quietly to go to church. The week she baptized the daughter died. Then the persecution started as her husband blamed her that due to her baptism and believe in Jesus, the child is cursed to die. Thank God her faith was strong. Later her husband also died. The family members want to perform Buddhist rites to bury him. She insisted that the burial should be Christian rites. The members of the husband family took the body and performed under Buddhist rites. She was very sad and during this time, there were a lot of persecution from the family members. At this time, she yearned for the members support. During this time, she prayed to God to comfort her. She saw 3 angels in white gown and at the back they carried at the back a long spear. The angels approached her slowly and smiled at her. God sent angels to comfort her. After the angels passed her, they turned back and nodded the head and smile at her. She rubbed her eyes and she close or open her eyes, she still saw the angels. That was the most lonely time in her life. The church members didn’t go because it was a Buddhist rites.  
-This happened but she persisted right to the end. It is indeed difficult if a church members married to a gentile husband and family. Even though she was newly baptized she still managed to keep her faith despite the death of her daughter and husband. She has endured to the end
Rev 2:10 Here those who persevere will obtained the crown of life.
