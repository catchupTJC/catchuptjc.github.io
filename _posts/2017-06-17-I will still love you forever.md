Only three things will remain eternally:
-	Faith 
-	Hope 
-	Love

We are all blessed with these gifts
“I will always love you”
A phrase commonly thrown around these days but does in fact truly means what it means?

Is our love dependent on the type of car that we drive or how thick our wallets are?

Ruth 1: 15-18
Ruth displayed strong loyalty to Naomi; this is the amazing story between a daughter and mother-in-law
When we have lost everything, who else is there to love us?
The story of Ruth and Naomi took an unfortunate twist when Naomi’s husband and sons had been plagued with death.

They had lost everything especially since society at that point in time were the traditional bread-winners.

Ruth and Naomi were then two parts of a broken family. What is touching about this story is how their love stood firm.
Now although Naomi indicated to her daughter-in-laws to return to their families, however, it was at this juncture that sincere companionship is most important for these women.

And Naomi made no secret that she is incapable of providing them with any joy (verse 8 & 12)

Naomi made the ultimate sacrifice – to put the needs of her daughters-in-law above her’s.
This is what true love is. To know what is best for your loved ones. 

In Verse 15, Naomi urged Ruth for the fifth time to leave and return to her family, to remarry and live happily.

However, Ruth manifested true love by reassuring Naomi that she would follow by her through and through.

“…your God shall be my God and your people my people…”
The love between Ruth and Naomi went beyond the call of in-laws. Ruth had marry into the family and carries with her all of their beliefs and hardship

The ultimate acid test for love is during times of hardship – how far are we willing to go for each other?
Do our knight in shining armor start to dull during the times when we need them the most?
True love transcends beyond the superficial. It has to possess sincerity and be tested over and over again.

It is also said that true love only begins after the point of marriage – everything before that is only a part of the infatuation phase

Jeremiah 31: 3
The love that God provides is everlasting. He never changes
Isaiah 54: 7-8
Here’s God’s declaration of His love for us.
Just because He loves us that doesn’t mean He won’t get angry at us for our transgressions.

True love will have its moments of anger but it is only for a moment. God’s compassion is everlasting.

Let’s put ourselves into God’s shoes. Imagine having to explain your love for your people only to be turned down and forgotten. He even sent prophets and disciples to evangelize amongst His people but resistance and skepticism still exists.

Hosea 1: 2-3
God instructed Hosea (a prophet) to marry a harlot (an adulterer). Will we still obey our God even at such ridiculous instructions? Do we truly shoulder the meaning of being a Christian when required to?

However, Hosea is submissive to the Lord although the burden of being a worker of Christ is heavy. It was his great sacrifice to the Lord.

This instruction is the metaphorical love of the Lord with His people. Though we often remain unfaithful, our Lord has stood by us and continues to love us.

But the situation gets even stickier. The harlot that Hosea married left Him and went on to marry her with another.

God was relentless and told Hosea to remarry her and look past her transgressions. This is how great the Lord’s love is for us.

Surely the Israelites hearing of this would mock Hosea. 
Lord did all this to make example to His people of the relationship He has with them. 

Would we have done the same if we are called upon by the Lord just like Hosea did?

We are likely miles away from possessing this type of love and loyalty but we have to continuously improve this aspect of our life.

Hosea 2: 19-20
‘Hosea’ means the salvation of God.
God’s love for us will be everlasting unless we consciously opt out of this relationship.

We who have the love of God should manifest it and show it.
