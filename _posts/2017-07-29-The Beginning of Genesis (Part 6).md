-Gen 1 shows God is love. 
-Gen 2& 3 It records the creation of God and from these chapters we also learn that God himself established the Sabbath
-Sabbath was established for men. Jesus Christ himself said that Sabbath was made for men and not men for the Sabbath. 
-God finished his work and creation and was satisfied. When God was satisfied for in his perfect creation, there will not be any darkness, death and sufferings which resulted from sin. 
-After his creation, we know God rested from his work . 

-Apart from establishing the Sabbath, God established 2 which is the Garden of Eden and He also established marriage which he himself personally did it. 

God prepared the Garden of Eden.
-Gen 2:8-17 The garden of Eden was planted in the East. The original meaning of the Garden of Eden is happiness. 
-God’s will when he established the garden of Eden which is garden of happiness so that men and animals will live in enjoyment and happiness. 

-Today men suffering and sin started in Gen 3 when man disobeyed the command of God. 

-So it was never the purpose of God that men live in suffering as in the beginning God created the world and even the 
Garden of Eden for their enjoyment and happiness. 

-In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, it is the will of God that in his riches blessed by God to share his riches with the poor. He did not. 

-We should have the correct attitude. God wants us to happy and enjoy but it is important that we have the love to also share this to the poor and unfortunate. 
-In geographical location this garden should be around Iran and Iraq. There were 4 rivers. Today only  2 rivers still exists. Tigris and Euphrates which is in the land of Iran and Iraq. 

-After the flood of Noah the geographical location changed so we do not know the exact location and can only surmise. 

-The purpose of the creation of Garden of Eden is for men for them to enjoy. 
-There are 3 kinds of trees 
1) Tree of every fruit. Different trees and different fruits and are pleasing to the eye. This fruits can be eaten. 
2) the tree of life. If you eat the fruit of the tree of life you can live forever. Even then, if there is no sin, there is no death. 
3) The tree of knowledge of good and evil. 

-Some argue if there is no tree of knowledge of good and evil then there is no sin. So God is the cause of their sin as he 
created this tree. Is this correct? 

-Today where is the garden of Eden? The garden of Eden is the house of God. Our members’ house is also the garden of Eden. 
-Be it in church or our houses, we must have this 3 types of tree. Every member, household we must have members that bear different types of fruits of the holy spirit such as love, joy, peace patience  kindness etc. 
-We have to put effort to grow the fruit of the holy spirit in the household. The father, mother, children will have to plant this fruit bearing trees. 

-We also need to plant the tree of life in church and in our homes. The tree of life is the word of God as the word of God is life. 
-We need to have the word of God implanted in church and in our homes. 
-Today in the home, we make every effort to have family altar so that the word of God which is the tree of life can be in the home.  
-Tree of knowledge of good and evil. This tree is important. This tree is the commandment of God. The church and home cannot go without this commandment of God. 
-If you eat of this fruit of good and evil you will die. If you don’t, you will live eternally. 
-The tree of knowledge of good and evil everyone must keep it. Every country has her own laws. Similarly in the church and home, the commandment of God must be there. 
-If there is no commandment of God, there is no limitation to the freedom of men. 
-God told them that all the fruit trees is for them for their enjoyment except this tree of knowledge of good and evil. This is the limit that they cannot cross. 
-All freedom must have their limits. Even in our natural body, if we overeat, we will also start vomiting which is a natural limitation of the body. 

-The tree of knowledge of good and evil is a form of limitation of freedom of God. If you do not eat this fruit, then you are good and if you eat it , then you are evil as you went against the commandment of God. 
-The tree is a testimony proof whether a person is good or evil ie whether man can obey God’s command or whether man will disobey God’s command. 
-So by the action of man, it can truly separate men whether they are good or evil. 
-So the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a witness and testimony. 

-From this one river it will branch 4 rivers.  In the garden of 
Eden there are a lot of gems such as gold. 

-Even though Adam and Eve was in the garden of Eden, they also had to work 
-Gen 2:15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. 
-A person cannot just be left idle and need to work to have the sense of responsibility and achievement. 
-Adam worked in the garden of Eden to help him to fulfill his responsibilities and attain achievement. 

-Apart from working in the garden of Eden, Adam need to keep the Garden of Eden. God would have forewarned Adam to be watchful and Adam has to ensure that the Garden of Eden is taken care of to keep it away from evil. 

-Not only he was supposed to watch and keep the Garden but Adam and Eve participated in sin. 

-Hosea 6:7 But like Adam they transgressed the covenant, there they dealt faithlessly with me. 

-Gen 3:1 now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field. So other animals were also crafty but the serpent was even more crafty. 
-So in Genesis 3 there have been some problems already. Adam did not keep the garden well and some of the animals have already changed which was solely his responsibility. 
-As leaders of the church are we role models. Do we make time for service or are we always late for service. Don’t come for morning Sabbath, morning prayer, services. Is there are problem then in church. 

-This was passed to Adam and he did not manage the garden of Eden well at all. Adam has transgressed the covenant. 

-The garden of Eden today represents the true church. Make a comparison the garden of Eden and the church. Eg Garden of Eden was established in the East and the true church was established in the East. 
-The garden of Eden was established by God personally and the true church was established by the holy spirit. 
-There are about 10+similiarities of Garden of Eden is like the true church today. 

Children is a heritage of God. The responsibility of parents to not only take care of their well being, their education but how about their soul and spirituality. 

The church is the same. We ask God to help and guide us to  manage and keep the garden of eden which is the church and home well. 

All glory to God.
