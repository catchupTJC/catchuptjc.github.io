-Gen 1 – The revelation that all creation is from God. 
-Gen 2 –God is love. In all the creation of God, he loved men the most. For men he established the Sabbath day and also created the Garden of Eden for them. He also established  marriage. Angels although created by God are only ministering spirit. However despite the creation of animals, angels, he still loved men the most. 
-All future blessings, glory is given to men and was willing to give life to men. Therefore we cannot say that God does not love us and this should not be uttered for he truly loves us. 

-The establishment of true Sabbath and the Garden of Eden which is now the church. 

-God  established marriage. Gen 2:18-25
-Marriage is not only involving only 2 persons but also involve 
God.  It also relates to parents and also parents of the other party and many other parties.
- Mal 2: 15 Did he not make them one with a portion of the spirit in their union? And what was theone god seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. 

-God established  marriage so that godly offspring can be brought forth. 
-God saw that everything was good but it was not good for man to be alone. 
-Gen 2:18 For God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a helper fit for him”. 
-Gen 2:20 The man gave names  to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. 

-Adam could not find any helper fit for him amongst all the 
livestock and birds. 

-As such Adam went through the process of loneliness and he felt a need to have a helper fit for him.
-God indeed created a good helper fit specially for him during this period of loneliness.
-A blessed marriage happens only when there is a need. 
-Nowadays many people feel that being alone is good so that 
you need not serve the partner and can spend your own 
money. It creates a mindset that living alone is good. 
-1 Cor 7:25-26 Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. 

-Paul clearly states that this is only his own opinion and here it clearly states that this is not the command of God. 

-The background during this period and the apostles were facing a lot of persecutions and they were in preparation of the end days.
 
1 Cor 7:27-29
-If you have a wife, do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But if you do marry you have not sinned and if a betrothed woman marries she has not sinned. 
This is only Paul’s opinion only but not the command of God.

-If you look at Genesis, God established marriage for Adam for it was not good for the man to be alone. 
-Marriage is good for men for the wife is able to share his burdens, take care, love and help him. 
-The role of the woman is to live for the husband. The purpose of create woman is to help man. 
-Behind every successful man is a successful woman. 
-However every successful man is 2 successful women which is his mother and his wife. 

-The values of the wife is mentioned in Proverbs 18:22 – He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favour from the lord. 

-The blessing of a good wife comes from God whether he obtains favour from the lord. 
-When finding for a good wife, it is important to pay importance to the heart and God fearing spirit. Do not only pay attention on appearance which can also be your downfall. 

-Prov 14:1 The wisest of women builds her house but folly with her own hands tears it down. 
-So it is important to choose a wife that is wise which can help 
and build your home and not tear it down. So it is important 
to choose God fearing spouse. 

-So choose a member even though in church that is a “sheep” and not “goat” in the church ie that is truly a good Christian which is God fearing. In church amongst members you may have members who are greed of money, false Christians etc. So we need to be vigilant. 

-If you are a God fearing member, God will give a good God fearing spouse. If you yourself is not holy, no love, not God fearing, you yourself must change - for it is not good for a God fearing wife to be given to you. 

-The words of God is important to keep on reminding us and guide us to lead us back to the path. 

All glory to God
