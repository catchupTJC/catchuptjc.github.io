-The period of the true church in the last days. 
-TJC at the end time until the great judgment. 
In between of this there are 4 period. 

1st period
Millenium period where Satan is bounded. 
The appearance of the white horse. The seal. Angel rise from the east so that the chosen ones are sealed. This is the period of sealing so that they will not be destroyed. 
There is also evangelical time. There are 2 preachers and fire came out from the mouths. Fire is the word of God and one is to cleanse them and to judge them. The gospel is to save and also to judge. 
-Believe and you will be saved according to the ways set. 
-Believe and you will save and if you don’t believe you will be judged and condemn. 
-The fire came out of the preacher to burn them. 
-Devil was bound during this period. 
-This is a milinium period and is also a period of grace

2nd period
The period of trampling. 
The loss of the period of the holy spirit. 
There is a falling star and open up a bottomless pit where the devil is bounded. 
There will be a period of locusts to anti TJC
There will be a battle. The legion of the devil will initiate this battle. 

Rev 11: 1-2 the measurement of the temple, court and holy city. The court outside no need to measure as this has been given to the gentiles and God will leave them as gentiles and no longer care for them. 
-They will tread the holy spirit for 42 months. 
-Daniel prophesy when the power of the church will be trampled. 
-Dan 12:7 Man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the stream he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by thim who lives forever that it would be for a time

-the power of the holy spirit will be completely shattered. 
-The power of the church will be completely shattered. 
-To measure the holy temple and next is the fall of the star .
-The corpse ie the church will be thrown at the side of the road. The gospel of the truth /door of salvation will be completely closed. Everything stops. 
-Rev 11: 7-10 them is the 2 preachers vs 4 and was killed from the beast (Satan) from the bottomless pit. Their dead body lie in the street . When the preachers killed, their dead bodies people from  Sodom & Egypt rejoice that these 2 preachers were killed. The preachers always rebuked them. The words spoken by the preachers were burning them.
- Rev 11:5 Fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them this is how he is doomed to be killed. 
-When the preachers were killed, the salvation of God stops . The corpses were lying for 3.5 days so it is not a long time. 
-This means the door of salvation is closed. There is no chance to hear any gospel and no opportunity to do any divine work. The church has been trampled. 
Before the door of salvation closed, the church has to be trampled first. 
-Rev 15:7-8 And the 4 living creatures gave to the 7 

Here it sattes that no one could enter the sanctuary until the 7 plagues of the 7 angels were finished. So the plagues started and it is indeed a horrifying period. This is after the door of salvation has been closed only the plagues will start. 
The temple was closed and it was filled iwht smoke from the glory of god and from his power so that no one can enter. 
-When in the TJC, do not depart from this church and once departed, you cannot enter anymore. For the door of salvation has closed. If you want to come to TJC, you must come early and whole heartedly believe. 
-When God said no one can enter it means the door will be completely shut and there is no more grace. 
-Lk 13:22-24 Someone asked Jesus, “will those who are saved be few”?  Strive to enter through the narrow door (heaven) For many I tell you will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door sayging …

The question how many is not important. What is important is how do you strive to enter heaven for heaven is like the narrow door and it is not easy to enter. 
-Jesus told a prophesy in Lk 13:24-25. For many I tell you, many will want to seek enter the true church and will not be able. They cannot enter. This is because once the master of the house (Jesus) shut the door and many outside open, open the door and Jesus will say “I do not know you”
-this is the time where the bowl of the 7 plagues have descended and many want to go to TJC ie the door of salvation but the door has been shut. Jesus has shut it. 
-Just like the time of Noah, during the time of building of the ark, no one wanted to enter. Even when every animal came in still wait for 7 days for those to come but they did not. The door was shut and during this time, many wanted to go in the ark but the door has been shut during the flood. God did not show mercy and the door has been shut as God has given so ample time for them to repent. 
-During this time when they slain the preachers, this is the time the door of salvation has been shut. 
-At this time the church has been taken up. 
-Then the plagues is for the gentiles and not to the members of the TJC or chosen ones. 
-The previous explanation, the overall explanation was simple. 
-TJC started at the end period. 
-Daniel prophesy of the vision of the statue. The golden head is Babylon, the arms is Persian nation, the next is Greece, The legs, the Roman empire which is the legs the period when Jesus was there. The period of apostles at the leg. This has all ended. Now left is the feet. What happened at the feet. God prophesy the true church TJC will be established. At the end days, the kingdom of God will be established. 
- Dan 2:42-45 And the toes of feet were partly iron and partly clay this is the kingdom of the last days. Then God will establish a new kingdom which is the true church and the kingdom will not perish and stand forever. There is no kingdom that will not perish such as Babylon, Persia, Greece which are strong but perish. Is there any kingdom that cannot perish except the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God shall not belong to any body. It is for the spiritual nation of God. This nation does not belong to this world and is separated
-This is talking about TJC. 
-Num 23:8-9 When Balaam wanted to curse the Israelites, he could not for the people dweeling alone and not counting itself among the nations. 
-TJC is separated from the rest. TJC has the power given from God. TJC preach and to judge the entire nation. All those who follow the devil will be judged. 
-God will set up a church with is a TJC. When the seal is opened and TJC is the appearance of the white horse.
-TJC is not like apostolic church as apostolic church period ended already. 
-TJC is the beginning of the end days. 
-Rev 2 sections : 
Rev 1: 19 Elder John saw 2 happenings in revelation. The matters that are present that he has seen and another matters is the future and those that are to take place after this. 
-Elder John during the apostolic churches will end. Revelation is the appearance of the TJC. 
-the millineum is the longest period where the grace of God is there so that many will be saved. 
-Trampling period compare to the millineum is shorter. The 3rd period is the dead corpse of 3.5 days. The last period is the “little while”
Rev 6:11 that they should rest yet for a little while until their fellow servants also and their berthen who should be killed . So they should wait a little while. 
-This little while is in Rev 12: 14 she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent. There is a period, as if a lot of time and then only half a time. 
-This is what jesus said if I did not shorten the time, even the elect will not be saved. So there is time, peace and then the time was cut off. 
-Measuring of the temple 
-Falling stars from the sky to the bottomless pit
-Armies of God and armies of Satan. 

TJC is still at the millennium stage already but going to the beginning of the trampling period. 
-Rev 9:1-2 5th angel sounded and I saw  a star from heaven fallen unto the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss and he opened the pit of the bayss and there went up a smoke out of the it . 
-Elder John saw a star from heaven (This star is from God) fallen from heaven to the earth. What happened to the fallen star? The star given the key to open the bottomless pit. The bottomless pit is where the devil bounded. So this falling star to release the bounded Satan. This fallen star to open the bottomless pit. The fallen star is from heaven. Who is this star. 
-Rev 1:20 the 7 stars and 7 lampstand. The 7 stars are the workers of God. The 7 lampstand is the church. The stars is the servants of God. 
-Rev 9 :1 is a servant of God that has fallen from the sky. He did not ascend to heaven but this is falls from the sky so this is not a good sign as he has been cast down. He is a fallen star a fallen servant cast down from God as they have sinned against God. He has the key to open the bottomless pit is to release the devil. Who gave the key to this servant to open the bottomless pit. Surely the key is from Jesus. How did the fallen servant of God has this key? 
Rev 9:1 Someone gave the key to this fallen servant of God to open up the bottomless pit to release heaven. 

-Rev 20:1-3 I saw an angel coming down out of heaven. This is not fallen down. Jesus bounded Satan, cast to the bottomless pit, tied by chains to the bottomless pit. The purpose is that devil will not deceived the nation. After 1000 years this devil will be released and be destroyed. 
-Rev 9:1 the 5th horn this is not the time to release the devil but the fallen worker want to release the devil. Jesus agree to this as well and gave him the key. 
-Jesus will appear in many forms, an angel, a sheep, high priest. Only Jesus has the power to bound the devil. 
-So the key is in the hands of Jesus. 
-Rev 9:1 The key was given by Jesus to this fallen star ie the fallen worker. Jesus has sealed the bottomless pit where Satan is bounded. The fallen worker only open a small hole/well in the bottomless pit. The entire seal is opened only inRev 20. But because it is a fallen worker he only opened a small hole. 
Rev 9:2 When he opened the pit of the bayss and there went up a smoke out of the it as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth and the power ws given them as the scorpions of  the earth. 
-The fallen worker to the earth and release the devil to attack the church. To devour all the believers. All this work is done by the fallen workers. 
-TJC . Who released the devil. Church history, preacher fall due to personal weakness eg adultery, some preacher greedy about the money of the church.  There are preacher who go against God. He release the devil to go against the truth, the church. 

-One example is the theory of self existence of the devil is to humiliate the omnipotence of God. A preacher was ex-communicated as he claimed that God is not only God and there is another God which is the devil. The devil is not fallen angel but another self existence God. If you self claimed that you are self existence it is claiming that Satan is God. He explained it is an evil God but our God is a kind God. This is heresy to the truth. 
-However  Bible is clearly states that all is created by God. There is no other God but him himself. There is no way Satan can be at par with God. Satan is created by God
The theory of the self existence devil is totally against the bible. He also claims that God is not omnipotent, omniscient. God regretted as if God did not know that men will sin. So he claim that there are things that God did not know what will happen. So this is humiliating God’s power and all knowing God. God has not ability to destroy the evil one. This God there is certain thing that he cannot do. This is not the God that we worship. 
-The fallen star which is a fallen worker will release the devil and Jesus gave the key to this fallen worker. 
-When Judas betrayed Jesus, Jesus actually warned him already. Jesus hinted that amongst the 12 disciples that someone will betray him. Jesus said that hand that dips the bowl is the one who will betray him. It was Judas’ hand that dipped. Jesus was already hinted and already clearly told Judas himself that it is him. Finally Jesus said, “What you are going to do, do quickly” Jn 13;27
-The smoke going out from the pit even covered the sky. Even some of the elders, deacons, members were deceived by YM Yang. This ex preacher really went against the truth and drawing members away from God. It is the work of the devil to split the church. 
-Elder Hsieh Soon Tao asked your devil self existence whether you have proof in the bible. Then elder asked him this ex-preacher YM Yang and said that he did not have. Then Elder Hsieh Soon Tao said why do you continue to preach. 
Another one in China recorded in a cassette asked whether there is any biblical versus about devil self existence and he said he did not have any biblical existence. 

-The key to the bottomless pit, this Satan released  will trample the members and can be from our own church. The gentiles will also trample us. 
This is about the fallen star. 
Rev 13:5-6 And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words and it was allowed to exercise authority for 42 months. It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against god blaspheming his name and his dwelling thiat is those who dweel in heaven. 

This dragon power comes from the devil. The dragaon is to glorify the devil or to speak blasphemous things against the truth. This is the mouth of the devil and the mouth of the beast. He will be given 42 months to trample the church, to speak heresies given power by the devil. He became the servant of the devil. 
Rev 9:6 Now he no longer the worker of god but has become the beast. The beast open his mouth to utter balsphemise. 
4 types
Blaspheme against God (Devil self existence)
Blaspheme the name of God, jesus
(He denied the teachings of Jesus. Feetwashing – he said wash 
or not it is ok. In the bible clearly states that if you don’t wash my feet you have no part in me. He said believe can get 10 points but if you want feetwashing can give another 2 points so (12 points) it is ok but no need also ok as it is already adequate. 
-Now come back to the truth but his truth is wrong. 

3) Blaspheme against the tabernacle of meeting which is the church today
-He preached TJC is not the only church that can be saved. TJC is the church that can be saved. But not the only church. Other churches also can be saved then why should come to TJC. Why need to be baptized in jesus name, why need to do feetwashing, why need to observe Sabbath….) What he did was blaspheming the tabernacle of God.

Blaspheme those belong and dwelling in the kingdom of heaven. 
-blaspheming those belong to God. We dwelling in heaven in spirit and angels. 
Holy communion a preacher who wants to holy communion sacrament. In the midst a brother said “stop” If you are a preacher you must be a just preacher. The brother said a committee to judge YM Yang is it correct or not. The preacher we are now performing the holy communion and you must answer. Is this paying the respect the holy communion and God? In their eyes there is no church, no respect , no reverence. He wanted immediate resolution. The preacher to be a just preacher need time to examine the evidence. Everyone was angry, the brother was angry at preacher, the others angry with him etc, the reverence of the holy communion was gone… Is this the work of the devil or the work of the God? It is clearly to judge. 

-This fallen star (the fallen worker of God) has become a beast for devil. 

-Where does this beast comes from . 
-Rev 11:7/  The beast comes from the devil for he rises from the bottomless pit . 
-Jer 10:21 For the shepherds are brutish and do not inquire of the Lord and therefore they have not prospered and all their flock is scattered.
-This shepherd can became a beast. Outwardly the shepherd appears to be of care and love but in actual fact are brutish.
Eg Eli 2 sons of priests lay with the women in the temple and also stole the animals sacrificed to God. Their act is an act of a beast. Any worker transformed to a beast?

Act 20: 28-30 Paul spoke to the people of Ephesus. Holy spirit moved paul to prophesy. Among yourself there will be wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock. These workers have become beasts devouring the members to draw them away from God. 
Act 20: 17 those Paul met were elders. These important workers has become beasts and devouring the sheep. 
The church in the apostolic churches were wolves. 
So in TJC if we know that we have wolves amongst the church  to devour, humiliate God, anti Christ – we cannot be friend or follow them. These are the fallen workers that is releasing the devil. We should cut immediate ties with them so that you will not be deceived further. 
The beast in revelation is talking about the fallen workers in the end time church.
