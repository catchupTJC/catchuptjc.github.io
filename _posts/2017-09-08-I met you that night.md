-When God created the heavens and the earth, he said let there be light and there was light. 

-God separated the light from darkness and he called the darkness night and the light he called day. 

-There was one night that this person met an angel

-Gen 19:1-5 This is the story of Lot in Sodom & Gomorrah. This night is the night before these cities will be destroyed. 

-Lot at this night met 2 angels. He also encountered a group of evil persons. 

-That night he met with the 2 angels who will bring him salvation but on the other hand the group of evil persons wanted to kill him. 

-The angels came to destroy the cities and they came at night. 

-The angels came to save and they can come to judge as well. 

-Lot’s attitude would determine whether he be saved or destroyed. 

-When Lot saw the angels he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth even though at that time he did not know they were actually angels. 

-This attitude of humility and utmost reverence of Lot bowing to the ground to invite and welcome strangers to his home to give them a feast and baked  unleavened bread really showed great love. 

-The angels actually rejected his offer as they wanted to spend the night in the town square. It was a form of test by the angels to Lot. 

-However Lot insisted strongly and because of his genuine love, he in turn received salvation for him and his family. 

-Why was he able to meet the angels? Why when angels rejected his offer, how did he reacted. 

-The city Sodom & Gomorrah was indeed a big city with a lot of activity. 

-Even at night, Lot was sitting in the gateway and there was activities at night during this busy city. The  people young and old were not asleep but this group came to Lot to hand over the 2 guests. 

-Lot begged them not to do this wicked deed but was willing to offer his 2 virgin daughters so that they can do anything with them.

-This was the extent of protection that he was willing to give to his guests to sacrifice his daughters to the evil mob. 

-How about us today? Do we have such love for others? If we were Lot, would we be like him to show love and hospitality to others who needs it? 

2)Gen 28:10-15 Jacob had to flee from his home. That night he dreamt there was a ladder set up on earth and the top of it reached to heaven. 

-It was a night which he was lonely, afraid as he was fleeing away from his home. 

-However in this dream, God comforted him that God will bless him and God will not leave him and will bring him back to this land. 

-This is the night he met God. He had done wrong, for he 
had deceived his father and his brother and he also done wrong against God.

-Although it was a promise that the older will serve the younger this was not how God wanted to bless Jacob. 

-When he was returning back home, it was also a night of fear 

-Gen 32:22-26 This was the same night he met God. 

-Gen 32:1 during the day, Jacob met the angels of God to protect him. 

-God will sent angels to protect the journey 

-At same night, he was alone. Then a man wrestled him to the ground until the breaking of day. 

-It was during this time to save his own life, Jacob wrestled with the man to overcome him with all his strength and might. 

-Later he knew that this man was God and God changed his name to Israel. 

-2 Cor 11: 13-14 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ and no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 

-there was a sister who wanted to go for a bible seminar conducted by a foreign preacher. The husband forbid her from going. But her husband slept and she was contemplating whether to go to church. There was a knock and there was a woman who said that she was to bring her to church. Jesus told her to bring her to church. When they were walking, this lady kept asking about her family. However when they were walking she realized that this was not the way to church. When she resisted, the lady turned to devil and pushed her to the lake. As she was in the lake, she shouted “Jesus save me” and 2 angels appeared. The demon quickly vanished and she was able to save herself out from the lake. The angels asked her to go back quickly home. 

-Preacher Daniel also one night after funeral while driving and saw the demon at the back of the car. Every night asked Jesus to protect and allow him to sleep throughout. One night Pr Daniel after eating supper he was about to go home, he saw a family of wild boars of 6 in front of his house. My wife was complaining how is it that this house that they bought have wildboars as my area is near the jungle. To me it was good thing to can see such animals in the city. 

-1 Sam 28:3-7 Now Samuel has died. Before Samuel died, King Saul always sought for Samuel. He did enquire God, but God did not answer. So he sought for mediums. Saul disguised himself and came to the woman by night. He said to the medium to call up a spirit. The woman said “I see a god coming up out of the earth” Was this God? No it was the demon as God doesn’t come out from the earth. 

-1 Sam 28: 13 He went to the medium, met the devil and King Saul worshipped the devil! 

-How  could the first king could be like this from worshipping God to worship devil! 

-When he was first king, he cut off the mediums and the necromances from the land as commanded by God. 

-Deut 18:9-13  Here God commands not to follow the abominable practices of the gentile nations. Not to burn their son or their daughter as an offering or practices divination or tells fortunes of interprets omens, or a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium or a wizard or a necromancer  for all this is an abomination to God. 

-In our lives, at night, who do we see? We can see the devil and there are some nights in the bible where they see angels and God. So let us be wary and not be deceived by Satan disguised as angel.

-We may see angel, evil people, demon disguised as angel, or even seek demon 

-How about the night where we meet Jesus
