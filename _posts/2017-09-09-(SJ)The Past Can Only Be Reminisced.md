-The grace of the Lord that was provided to Adam and Eve can only be reminisced after they were banished from it

-Gen 4: 1
Here describes Eve conceiving a child. It was described as a man child with the help of the Lord.

-It showed that although they were banished from Eden, she still gave thanks to the Lord for providing her with a child. The child was named Cain.

-But was Cain truly conceived with the Lord’s help or was he the by-product of sin and sorrow?

-Cain as we understand is a wicked man. He killed his own brother, Abel. It is also interesting to note that the name Abel meant vanity and sorrow.

-This perfectly describes the emotions running through Adam and Eve once the grace of God was taken away from them.

-What will we become once we have drawn our final breath?
-The grace provided by the Lord should not be taken for granted. Let us not make the same mistake.

-There are three sorrows
1) Not being able to obtain what we desire
2) Obtained their desires but turns out to disappointing
3) Not treasuring what we have at the present and only to reminisce it when it is lost.

-Moving on, let’s talk about the past of the Israelites.
-Ps 137: 1-4
The rivers of Babylon was filled with amazing scenery. However, the Israelites were weeping sorrowfully for it reminded them of their home and temple in Jerusalem.

-The pain of regret for not heeding the advice of the Lord and prophets was too much for them to contain. 
-In fact, there were numerous prophets that were sent by the Lord to preach to the Israelites to repent but they were all killed, one-by-one.

-They would have rather listen to the words of the false prophets for it was what they wanted to hear. They were choosing to be ignorant to the words of the Lord.

-The Israelites could only have thought to themselves of the home they once had. Their punishment was for 70 years.

-The punishment cost them an entire generation.

-Verse 2:
The only thing that Israelites could have done was to hang their harps on the willows – indicative of them setting aside their form of entertainment and joy.

-The Israelites were in pain from what could have been.
-Their tormentors mocked the Israelites grief by forcing them to dance and sing for them.

-They also wish for them to forget their God and homeland.

-Verse 5:
The Israelites made this their resolution to the Lord.
They only wish to get back into His good graces and were willing to go through sorrow and grief to get there.

-It is fundamentally important that as we chase success in this world, we musn’t forget our Lord and Savior.

-We need to inspect our own hearts and determine if we are getting contented with our faith or do we still have that burning desire to give praises to the Lord.

-In previous Spiritual meetings, the presence of the Holy Spirit would have been described as a ‘downpour’ as oppose to the ‘drizzle’ that we are experiencing today.

-It appears that the perception of the believers towards the Spiritual Meeting has changed overtime as well.

-We need to chastise ourselves from all the impurities of the world. We musn’t wait until the Lord is beyond rebuking us.
