-Recap versus in Eph 4:11-16 in Part 1.

-Paul emphasis the importance of gifts. These gifts to equip the workers and the workers to equip the members. In this the church can be developed together. 

-There is a clear aim and goal how the church can be developed. 

-The first goal is to be in one in truth. We should improve ourselves in the word of God. 

-To truly understand the word of God. This model of faith is entrusted to us and we must be clear of this. 

-We cannot be contented with this and must seek continuous growth. 

-We must have the right proportion with the body and head. 

-Paul emphasized from the Eph 1-3 we need to work together with Christ. So man and Christ can be one with him. 

-The body must work according to the will of God to be one with Christ. 

-Eph 4:14. It is natural phenomenon that will happen after 4:13 happened. Eph 4:15-16 should happen.

-Paul is talking about the church as a whole. 

-After Eph 4:14  it shows the individual of members. 

-Paul said for a church that is mature will not have any children. What does children mean here? 

-The children here means are those ignorant. This is different when Jesus said Love the little children whereby these little children is innocent. 

-However here in this verse the children that did not mature is those who are ignorant in faith. 

-What will happen to ignorant children. They will easily be tossed by the wind of doctrines ie influenced by false doctrines. 

-Those who are not mature in faith they are not able to withstand false teachings and doctrines. 

-This is a serious matter and the latter churches during the apostolic period. When Paul left the church, false teachings crept in the church. 

-For True Jesus Church we will also face the same thing. When we see the signs and miracles of other churches in other denominations, they too will be influenced. 

-In TJC there was a Hong Kong actress and had a new apostolic church. They had the ability of signs and miracles which seems to be amazing and more powerful in terms of signs of the spirit. 

-So many were influenced and these members did not discern the truth preached by the lady actress who called herself as prophetess. 

-After discerning the teachings taught by her, it can be clearly seen that the teachings did not abide in the bible. 

-How is it that these members cannot discern between falsehood and truth? This is because they faith and zeal is not based on the truth and on the bible. 

-As such without the foundation of the truth and of the word of God they are easily influenced and fall away despite the zeal that they have. 

-As such we need to have faith based on the biblical truth and of the word of God so that we will not be influenced by falsehood. 

-Eph 4:15 What method should we use for the body to join with the head which is Christ Jesus? Speak in truth in love is how we will be able to join with Jesus Christ. 

-Love and truth is important which will decide whether we are joining the body with the head. 

-The importance of truth and the motives that we have. The actions that we have will decide the truth that we have. 

-If a person speaks in truth it must be accompanied with love. 

-A person that speaks truth but without love will be a cold message and is not something the church should have. 

-So love must be accompanied with truth. 

-Every member is an important part of the body. 

-In between the bones will have the cartilage. Eg if we use our car, we need lubricant. 

-Every member forms part of thebody. Every member will have different gifts. These gifts will allow members to different offices and roles. 

-In the limitation of time and space, different members will have different  views which may cause frictions, misunderstandings. 

-Love will be an important to resolve these frictions and misunderstandings. 

-With love to overcome others’ weaknesses and also to be patience with others’ shortfall.

-Without love, we expect immediate action after a sermon delivered. But with love, we will have more patience with others. 

-Love and truth we should neglect any one of it. If we have love without truth then it is spoiling which result badly as in a spoilt child. 

-If we keep compromising without any standards this is not correct either. A child that is spoilt cannot discern what is right or wrong. 

-similarly in church if we keep on emphasizing on love without discerning what is right or wrong in the truth this is also wrong. 

-So love and truth must come together. 

-One member had embraced a wrong concept but the CMC continued to compromise and continue to love the member. Gave him responsibility to be the leader of a cell group. They did not care his wrong thoughts and perceptions. They only using love without the truth which caused problems. When he was the leader of the cell group he created a group self centered. He became opinionated leader and his own opinion became the opinion of the cell group. When he started to become strong and did not listen to the members who accepted him in the past and influenced more not to come to TJC. In the end the situation was out of control. Initially they used love and not using truth to correct the member. Because of this superficial relationship this has made the situation worse. 

-Love without truth in the long run also will not be good either. Love and truth are 2 important component. 

-Truth without love will be a cold message that cannot touch anyone. 

-Love without truth will spoil and make worse the situation. 

-Every part of the body will have to work hand in hand so that they can function properly. 

-Working with one another is important as every part of the body is not an individual. 

-Everyone of us is not the same and every part of the body has their own purposes. 

-In church we need all parts of the body to function together and not all can be legs or hands or eyes which will not work well at all. 

-In order for every part of the body to work well, therefore we cannot have rankings thinking one part is more important than the other.

-The bible tells us every organ of the body is important and they cannot live alone. Without one part the body cannot function properly. 

-When we work in church how do we have this working together? Some may think the best way, is to work alone to get work done. This individualistic attitude seems that the church can function but in reality, it is not the most healthy method. 

-If our body parts are not linked together then it cannot function well eg the eyes cannot pass the message that is seen to the brain, legs cannot move well if it cannot be coordinate well etc. 

-Therefore it is important that all bodies must work together so that the church can grow. 

-In any functions all are knitted together. Eg if there is a RE Evangelistic session, then the Re children needs to prepare with the teachers, evangelical team will need to be activated to pass pamphlet, treasure and cooking team working together to prepare the food, parents are supportive, members bring the friends – then this evangelical will be run well. 

-However if this session does not have the support of the parents, evangelical team, members are not supportive in bringing friends and  are not working together etc, then this session will fail. 

-So a church of growth should not have any children but must have mature members which are grounded by the truth whereby they will not be influenced by any wind of doctrine or false teachings. 

-Paul also taught that truth must also come with love. Both are important for the body to function well . 

-Every body part is not an individual and must work together with other parts to be a fully functional body. 

All glory to God.
