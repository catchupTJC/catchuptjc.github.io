The church of the True God is 
1) The church that has the abidance of God (Mt 18:19-20)
2) The church that has the providence of God 
3)The church that healed by God. (Mt 1:14)

The church of the true God is 
4) The church that is comforted by God (2 Cor 1:3-5)
-God is the father of mercy and God of all comfort. He will grant us all kinds of comfort. Why do we need comfort? Though we believe in Jesus Christ we still face all kinds of afflictions and troubles. Whatever afflictions, God will give us comfort and help us through these troubles. We will be able to comfort those in troubles too. 
-Sometimes we do not know sufferings as we are so comfortable in our lives. When we experience sufferings or poverty we can then understand those who are in this situations. Only then we are able to comfort them. 
-There is an old believer, there is something bad happened. She will cry every time she remember the incident. During that time, she will cry until the eyes swollen. She could not be comforted even though members/ministers tried to comfort her. One day 2 angels appeared before her and said, “Don’t be sad anymore” I cannot but be sad. Then don’t cry anymore. She replied, “I cannot help but cry”. Then the angel said I will wipe your tears away. Then the angels at the back sprouted wings and with the wings wiped her tears. Then the angels told her that they will sing to her. When the angels sang, all her sorrows disappeared. Suddenly she heard a sound of trumpet from heaven. The angels said to her, “we have to leave”. When she heard that she begged the angels and caught on to angels to stay on but the angels said that they have to return to heaven. 
-Jesus has promised that he will go to prepare many mansions for us. 
-When we have the glory and power to reign. The Jesus Christ has gone away to prepare this for us. When he is ready he will give us a new world for us. 
-When they were about to leave they told her to sing hymn 145. Trust in the Lord. That is our faith to totally trust in the  Lord.  Our faith is to stand on our own and not dependent on the angels.
-In these times of trouble we will be independent on our own faith and through these sorrows, we are able to entrust to God and that is true faith. 
-Few days later she observed the Sabbath. When she entered church there is a hymn singing during pre service. She then remarked this is the hymn that the angels sang to her. The angels were singing hymn 142 Come ye Disconsolate. When we have anguish and despair to trust in the Lord. 
-the church of the true God is where God comforts. 

The church of the true God is 
5) The church that is promised by God (1 Jn 2: 25)
The promise of God is to give eternal life which is more precious than anything. The Lord Jesus Christ gave a promise that he will resurrect us on the last days. Lazarus was raised after death and yet he died again. In our church, we have testimonies that those who have died also was healed by God and resurrect again. However after this, they will still pass away. 
-Similarly with sicknesses, when healed, there will be still other sicknesses. We are in the flesh and there will be sicknesses but this healing is temporary. 
-What is more important is to have eternal life and be in the glory of God and ever lasting holiness and joy. This is what it means is eternal life and this is the promise given by Jesus to us.  
-There is a believer who loved God throughout from young, even when she was married with family. Despite that she continued to love and serve God. 
-When she was old she continued to love God and serve God. She continued to serve by coming to church to pray for all the members and her family. Even in her bed, there will be the list of members to pray.
-when the members were praying for her, they saw her ascended to heaven. Although she was old when she was sick on the bed, but her appearance looked young and beautiful adorned in white garment. She was holding a cross ascending to heaven. Then she turned back and said to the members. “You must hold on to the promise of God” The promise of God is eternal life. Are we holding to this promise? A lot of people are not holding fast to eternal life and sometimes not holding firm enough when troubles come.
When ascending to heaven, she was holding firmly to the white cross. Cross is the salvation of Jesus Christ so that through jesus we can receive the eternal life and salvation grace to ascend to heaven. 
-We all have this promise of eternal life we need to hold fast to this promise.
The second statement she said, “God will not forsake, only men will forsake God” 
-A person will forsake God first and then God will leaves us. Why did God leave Samson. From the beginning, Samson is a Nazarite. He cannot touch dead bodies yet he touched dead bodies. He cannot eat unholy things, yet he ate them. He is not suppose to cut his hair and yet it was done. He continually forsake God and so God forsook him. 
-Jesus Christ gave many chance for Judas to repent. Many times Jesus told him straight, “You are the person who will betray him” Jesus gave him a chance to repent but he did not. This is despite the many miracles and teachings that he has seen and heard. 
-Finally Jesus told him, “ Do what you need to do quickly” Jesus has already given up on him. 
This testimony tells us this. 
1)Hold firm in the promise God. 
2)God will not forsake but men will forsake. 
Church will never leave, it is members that will leave the church. It is men that will forsake the truth and word of God. 

The church of the true god is 
6) The church that is blessed by God (LK 24:50-51)
The last task that Jesus did is to bless the believers. While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was carried up in to heaven. As he was ascending he continued to bless them. –Before Jesus departed from them, he bless them on earth and today he continues to bless us. 
-If we want to be bless by Jesus, we need to come to church to receive the blessings. 
-There is a church in Malaysia, though the members are poor yet the church building is beautiful and they will keep the church clean and very well. There are a lot of plants, bamboo trees and a pond with fishes. Somebody will need to maintain the church. 
-To build the church is another thing but to maintain the church needs continued care and a lot of labour .
-One day there was a preacher and a truthseeker. After preaching, they prayed. In this prayer, this truthseeker saw Jesus coming up the stairs and he was radiant and glorious. Even his face was shining and radiant. 
- The church mainhall is upstairs and she saw Jesus nodding his head in approval. This is good as the prayers obtained the approval of Jesus. 
-In the vision, she saw Jesus going to the podium. Then she saw jesus raised 2 hands. She has never seen benediction of the church so she did not understand why Jesus raised the 2 hands. 
-Then preacher ended the prayer. She asked preacher why the prayer was so short and asked preacher you should pray longer. 
-Just now I saw Jesus Christ looking at our prayers and I saw 
jesus to raise both his hands. I wanted to see what 
he was doing and you ended the prayer. 
-The preacher praised God, “Hallelujah” and told her that Jesus was blessing  the church, bless the members, bless the truth seekers.
-It is important to pray on our own rather than just solely be dependent on preachers prayer or other prayer without your own effort. 
-The church is a church that is blessed by God. So it is important that we come to church ourselves to pray and to receive the blessings. This cannot be dependent on others. 

-The church of the true God is 
(7) The heavenly Jerusalem (Heb 12:22-23)
The church of God is the heavenly Jerusalem. The church is spiritual . There are thousands and innumerable of angels in this gathering. 
-Preacher in charge was suppose to give report on the  church he was pasturing. He told them that the church was filled with members. Nobody could believe it. 
-There was a believer who was ashamed on the poor attendance of church service. He continued to pray to God as everytime the service was on, it was not giving glory to God but it was a shame. The other church instead was filled with their members. There are members in the TJC but there were weak in faith and did not attend services. During the service the old believer continued to go to church and during that service, physically there is only a few members but God open their eyes and saw innumerable angels sitting in the church hall. 
-Even though the members don’t come, but the angels will be attending service and in another testimony in the church of Guang, members heard the singing hymns of angels. 
-When the annual report, the trainee preacher said it was filled but not filled with members but filled with the angels. 
-Angels praying in the front row in church and the angels singing in church and the angels looking after the church. 
-In the church there is innumerable angels. 

The church of the true God is 
8) The church that is established on the top of the mountain (Is 2:1-2)
-Sis Wang was previously from another church and was fervent in the other church. Although she was fervent but she felt that she was drawing further away from God. She could not feel the presence of God. This is strange. 
-During one prayer, God gave her a vision. She dream that her husband and the whole family was on top of the mountain. 
-Across the mountain there is crosses. Some crosses are made of wood, some branches. On top the mountain there is a cross that is radiant and shinning. She was following her husband and her children was also following. As they were climbing the top of the mountain, she was thinking to herself that it is such as far journey. But she felt it was not right as the road was straight and not winding. 
-In TJC, the teachings may not be so easy to follow eg Sabbath day, cannot eat food offered to idols, cannot smoke or drink, cannot do a lot of things compared to the rest of the churches. 
-Not long they were reaching the top but there was a river blocking their way. They saw many people just jump into the river and then was raised up to go across. To enter the mountain top, they need to be immersed in the river and from the river to go up from the water and then they saw the church on top of the mountain, “ True Jesus Church” . At that time she did not know TJC and God personally showed her his church and showed her that she must be totally immersed into the water. This is the temple of God. 
-The church, TJC is the chief of all mountains and the cross was radiating compared to the rest of the crosses at the lower plain. 
-A friend recommended a doctor that is good and caring. So her husband took her to the doctor’s house as she was sick. 
In the house at the wall, the words on the wall was 
 “Baptize for the remission/forgiveness of sin” 
‘Foot washing is being part of Christ”
‘Sabbath day is to keep the commandment. 
‘Holy spirit etc”
So on the wall of the doctor’s house, she was amazed on what she read and started truth seeking of the TJC. When she was in TJC, she dared not even eat or drink as the pastors warned them not to eat or drink in the TJC as they may be influenced.
After attending the services, she felt that what was preached was according to the bible and she felt there was nothing 
wrong in TJC. There was order. 
-This testimony was bore by a believer when she was in other church and now is our church. 

-The church of the true god is 
9) The church that preaches/teachers the words of God (Is 2:3)
The church of God, the top of the mountain, the Zion mount will preach the words of God.
Sis Wang attended the church for about a year. So 2 of the pastors of her former church came to her house and asked her not to go to TJC. After that pastors held hands in a circle and they prayed in words and then they pray one by one ini words. She was anxious when it was a turn, she prayed in the name of jesus, hallelujah. She saw a vision and she saw a big church hall, it was empty and the 2 preachers were naked and was on the floor before the pulpit. Although there were many members of the other churches, in God’s eyes, it was empty as these members are not washed by the blood of Jesus and their sins are still there. The 2 pastors were naked as they were still with sins. Then she saw Jesus on the pulpit and then Jesus pointed her to tell the 2 persons that this pulpit is mine and they are not allowed to simply preach my teachings. Then it was her turn and she said this, “In the name of Jesus I pray, Jesus said that this pulpit is mine and you are not allowed to simply teach his doctrines” The 2 pastors took their begs and came out from the house. The husband scolded her but she told her husband this is the vision she saw. 
-the church of true God teaches the words of God. 
-The pulpit is God’s and those speaking must speak the words of God and not your own doctrine or opinion. 
-The pulpit is not for a show to show off our knowledge. 
-This is to allow us to know though the other churches may have love but do not speak the words of God, this church do not abide in God. 
-So a church must abide in the words of God. The life of God is manifested in the church through the words of God. 
- In the end days, many people of the world may not be 
attracted by the truth and the word of God. In order to attract more people some have deviated from the truth eg change the Sabbath to Sunday, celebrate Christmas etc.
-The truth must be uphold in the true church which may not be acceptable to the people of the world. Despite all this the truth must be maintained.
-Revelation, Jesus asked us to wash our garments, to repent and be holy. 
-TJC in the past, present and future will continue to hold to the truth and will not be influenced by the waves of the world. 
-When we come to church, we want to hear the word of God. That should be our stand that when we are in the church, we want the eternal life, go to the heavenly Jerusalem. 
Is 2: 3 come, let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways that we may walk in his paths. For out of zion shall go the lwa, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 
 

10) The only church that can stand firm (Rev 6: 15-17)
- Who would be able to stand when the Lord comes?
- When the world is at peace, we would have a tendency to take things for granted and forsake God.
- But on judgment day, would we still be able to stand and meet Jesus?
- In chapter 7, it speaks of the 144,000 who are sealed (saved) 
- These are in reference to those who remained loyal servants of the Lord.
- Do we allocate enough time for the Lord? Have we gotten too attached to the world?
- Also be warned that the door of the gospel can also be shut
- We must make haste to gain our salvation during our short tenure here 
- (Rev 15: 7-8) – The wrath of God is filled in the seven golden bows. The temple was the only safe haven but people were no longer allowed to re-enter the temple (meaning that those who have left would be denied entry to the temple).
- (Luke 13: 22-23) – Jesus did not answer on the quantity of the people that will be saved. Instead, he mentions that that shouldn’t be of his concern but be focused on being part of those who are to be saved.
- Many will try to enter through the narrow door and will not be able to
- What is our behavior like when we attend church? Do we strife to be part of the Lord’s salvation?
- Contrary to common belief, not everyone who knows God will be saved. It must be match with their actions and servitude towards the church
- The Lord has warned us of this twice; once during His tenure here as Jesus and the other through revelations provided to John much later.
- Rev 15 speaks of the wrath of God from the seven golden bows in the end times. 
- (Rev 14: 9-11) – Those who worship false gods will face the Lord’s wrath. 
- The Lord will not show mercy in the end times. Mercy is only shown to everyone prior to His coming.
- (Matt 24: 17-18) – Jesus warns us all to be steadfast and prepared.

11) The church of God is the heavenly city
- Hebrews 11: 16 – The God has prepared a city for His servants. 
- The tree of life and river of life are in the church
- Rev 22: 1-2 – The heavenly city has both the tree and river of life. True Jesus Church is that heavenly city.
