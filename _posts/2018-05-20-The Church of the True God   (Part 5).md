-The church of the true God is a church constantly reminds us. He will even warn. This is done because he loves us. 
How does God warn us? 
Job 33: 14, 15-18

-God has tried his best. He talk to us we do not want to listen. Eg we listen sermon after sermon. God will continue to talk to us so that we will not be lost. He speaks to us in dreams and in visions. These are the other alternatives that God communicates to us. 

-That through dreams and visions that God speaks to the people so that they do not fall. 

The church of the true God 
13) is the church that is reminded and warned by God (Job 33:14-18)

-There are some believers that is fervent and zealous. 

-There are some believers who are weak and cold at the point they are dying spiritually . They can come to church once a year 

-There are some believers who are lukewarm. How would jesus warn this lukewarm believers. 
This believer dreamt that he was in a bus on the way to heaven. In the bus there were young, old people. There were children and in the same bus, he saw himself looked very old although he was 40+ years old. (spiritually he was baptized from young so he was considered as an old believer) 

-Then he saw Satan all dressed in black and fierce. What was more frightening that the devil was holding a knife. The believers that was fervent in the front rows and was all alert, the devil passed them. The last few rows the passengers were sleeping and some were even drooling. The devil was not even interested. The devil was only interested those in the center which is believers who are lukewarm. The believers in front was watchful and alert. The Satan do not want to touch these believers as they are alert and it takes a lot of effort to make them fall. The last passengers sleeping, the Satan no need to do anything as these passengers will leave the church on their own. The Satan’s time is not much and he will spend time to the lukewarm believers. When he saw the Satan, he dared not sleep and Satan was waiting. It was a norm and habit he gradually fell asleep. While he slept, the devil stabbed him. He woke up from the dream. He was sad. He went to church but the door was locked. He was knocking and he was crying outside the church. He felt that he has been stabbed and killed by the devil. The more he thought of it the more he cried. Jesus, please forgive me. He thought he has died and killed by Satan. So he asked jesus, since I am going to hell, let me have a glimpse what hell would be like. 

-Jesus led him have a glimpse of hell. As he was crying the church door, the floor outside the church was separated. Inside he heard a lot of people screaming and shouting. So he took a look. He saw the earth had many levels filled with fire. Even in the first layer was so hot and dare not go to the next level. He begged jesus to forgive him and said he did not want to go there. Then the angel came and took his hand and brought him to heaven. The heaven is so beautiful. The flowers and fruits cannot be found on earth. There was a kind of fruit is so beautiful. He was thinking can I pluck and eat it. As he was thinking the fruit just flew to his hand without plucking. (What does it mean? Whatever you desire in your heart, you will get it as your heart will be pure and holy in heaven).
The descriptions in heaven is to illustrate to us how beautiful heaven is. 

-He saw many houses. He asked the angel, “ Angel, could I have a chance to live here. In fact you have a house here. “

-The angel brought him to his house. He wanted to enter but the angel said this house belongs to you but you cannot enter . Jesus has work for you. Jesus wants you to warn others. 
The believers have love the world. They have a lukewarm towards God. Tell them to repent. Jesus is coming soon. 

-Bring this warning to the members. 

-Is it true? What is our heart towards Jesus? Do we hold a lukewarm heart towards God. Can we say they are weak. Yet they come to church. Most of the time they are cold spiritually. Those who are watchful and vigilant the devil will need to spend a lot of time to wait for them to sleep. The ones that are already asleep as they will fall on their own. The devil will attack those in lukewarm. 
This happen 2 years ago in Australia. Through all this vision, Jesus is reminding us. We have a lukewarm attitude towards Jesus is because we love the world. 

-1 Jn 2:15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. I f anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him. 

-Some are missing in church services. Your heart is not with God. If you love the world you cannot love God. It is a warning . 

The church of the true God is 
15) The wife of the lamb (Rev 19:7-9, 21:9-10)
We are all bride of Jesus Christ.  Of all the people of the world we are chosen to be the wife of jesus Christ. 

-Rev 21:9-10 

-The bride , wife of the lamb is the heavenly Jerusalem. 

-The book of Ephesians talk about the love of husband and wife. 

-Jesus loves his wife so much that he gave his life for the wife. In the earlier portion of Ephesians he was talking how to love the wife and he then related this to Jesus relationship

-the church is the true God is the bride of the lamb. 

-Rev 19:7-9

-Here Jesus is bringing his wife. The bride has made herself
 ready waiting for Jesus Christ. This are the true words of God. 

-During every funeral of every member it is actually a spiritual marriage. Jesus is welcoming his bride back to his eternal home. Why do we not grieve as this is something worth rejoicing. This is the time Jesus will welcome his bride. 

In Indonesia when a brother passed away. The Indonesian maid saw his master in wedding garment waiting at the hall. He was serenity and smiles in his master. Slowly he went out from the door. There were 2 angels took him. Before he left he turned his head and wave goodbye. This is the testimony of the Indonesian maid. She cannot understand why the master is dead and why is he adorned with wedding garment. The lamb Jesus is welcoming the bride. When the maid told the master’s wife and the wife cannot see anything. She quickly ran to the husband’s body and felt a little warmth left in the body. He was all dressed and ready. 

-The church of the true God is the wife of the Lamb. Being the wife of the true God we need to be prepared and adorned. 

-To wait for the coming of the bridegroom Jesus Christ. We do not know when bridegroom will come to take us up. 

-Our responsibility is to get prepared for this coming. Some are taken up by chariot just like Elijah. 

-There is a brother sleeping he was woken up by cheerful and merry music. The people playing drums, trumpets in the olden times. He was curious who was going to marry today. As he looked out of the window and saw a band of people coming towards him. The leader of the group came in front of him. He asked the band of people, he said it was you who are going to get marry. He was surprised and he said he did not know. He is still in his pyjamas and he was not prepared and still asleep. He is still sleeping and thought it was for other people. This is a dream a vision that Jesus is reminding us. Jesus is coming soon, you need to be prepared. 

-The question we need to ask ourselves.

1) Are we ready?

2) Being a bride have we fulfilled the duty as a wife? 
All the testimonies to tell us what the church of the true God is like. We have biblical support that testimonies are true to remind us. Jesus has given TJC too many miracles.
