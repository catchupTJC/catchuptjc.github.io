The church of the true God is 
12) The church that is judged by God (1 Pet 4:17-18)
-1 Pet 4:17-18 Judgment will begin in the household of God first. This means that God will begin judgment with the members of the church first. 
-Members have heard the truth, received the salvation of truth grace and mercy from God. Expectation and judgment 
will begin for those who know first and receive the salvation. 
-As such we need to hold fast & tightly to our truth. 

Witnessing 1
In Indonesia, a deacon testified to Pr Daniel. In a dream he was going to church. When he was opening the door he felt  fear. He saw a naked preacher being bound in his hands and was kneeling down receiving judgment. Above the head of the preacher, there was a big sword. He shouted to Jesus, “no don’t punish him” Then he heard a stern and angry loud voice saying, “Don’t pray for him”.  There was no longer any mercy of Jesus towards him. 
-We have to take note that sometimes when a person sinned against God, God will no longer have any compassion towards the sinner. Under this circumstance there is no need to pray for the sinner. 
-The sword beheaded the head of the preacher and blood splattered everywhere in his face. 
-When he woke up from the dream, he could still smell the blood all over him. He did not even had the appetite to eat that day even though it was just a dream. 
-Jesus is the Lord of compassion but He is also a judge and can be a judge filled with wrath as he is a holy God. 
-Ezekiel 9: 6 this is the fearsome. The temple of God has been defiled and God impose his judgment. God instructed to kill all men except those who has a mark. 
-The angel started to slay first the elders, preachers, deacons right to the bottom. This is an important warning to the ministers and all members that judgment will begin with the members who knows the truth. 
-Ecc 5: 2,6  Be not rash with your mouth nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few. 
-So, when you come before God, do not be hasty or impulsive in your speech. When you speak rashly, it is not glorifying and God is in heaven will listen and judge. 
-So let our words be few. 
-Ecc 5:6 Let not your mouth lead you into sin and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands. 

-Don’t let your words destroy all the work that you have done and do not allow God be angry with our voice.

There was a member who was humble and offered to God. He 
was successful in his business and will offer more than RM100K every month. He will offer much and willingly. Initially he was humble and offered quietly. Later he was praised so much that he was not alert and pride crept in. He started to impose his own wish even though he was a member and not a minister or CMC. Once he was rejected of his proposal, he was angry. He told the church to return his offering for the month which was more than RM100k. Although he was advised that this was not correct in the eyes of God, he insisted to return his money. The church returned the money and he also insisted that a prayer be held even though preacher said it is not necessary. During the prayer, there was a loud voice, “ I am not pleased, I am not pleased”. The member heard and was afraid. However he did not at that time asked for repentance and forgiveness. He just returned home and after a few days, he died. He just passed away suddenly not because of any illness. 
-Do not just murmur against the church when you are not happy or pleased. You need to also consider whether Jesus is pleased. 
- As members we should not look up and respect those who offer a lot of offerings. We should also look at the heart of the members who love God and offer with thanksgiving to God. 
-Thanks the grace of God a lot offered humbly with thanksgiving.

A couple liked to murmur against the leaders of the church, members etc. This couple will support one another to attack and slander. It was weird to everyone as the church was just doing what was normal and did not do anything against them. They were advised not to attack the church by many members but they even spoke foul language and scolded  and attack more the church leaders. 
One day, while this couple was walking, there was a great sound of thunder and the lightning struck them both and their bodies turned like charcoal. 
-They were not even beside each other but one was in front and one at the back. Yet the lightning struck not at one spot but was able to strike both of them. All the clothes were burnt and their bodies naked black like charcoal. There were other people around but it only struck on both of them which was a punishment from God.
-It is a pity, they continued to criticize on others but did not reflect on their own weaknesses. There was no one who offended them yet they continued to slander and murmur against the leaders and members of the church. The heart was not pure. They sinned and failed to repent.

This happened recently. There was a group of workers who wanted to be leaders and started lobbying. This deacon who was the leader of the group used church money to give wages to his own group of workers. The church was rich as there were a lot of members that offered.
- This group started to attack the Council and wanted to separate from the Council. This deacon even raped another sister who was beautiful of which the husband died recently. This sister reported to the council and investigation was made. On the contrary of admitting his sin, the deacon accused the council of collaborating with the sister to falsely accuse him of this false charge. This sister was so sorrowful as she was a victim and this has put her reputation was also in shreds . 
One day during holy communion, the workers in the same group led by the deacon was distributing the holy communion.  and while serving suddenly fell and died. This then happened to another worker of the same group who suddenly fell and died. The deacon leading  the holy communion was so fearful of this, quickly ran out from the church leaving the service. They made the police report over this incident and the third worker of this group returned home. When he was near his doorstep, he suddenly fell and died. 
The next day, there was another worker in this group, also felt uncomfortable and while going to the hospital, he too suddenly died even before reaching the hospital. In total there were 4 deaths in 2 days from this group.  
-The deaths were actually clear punishments of God. Their evil deeds were not pleasing to God and was rejected by God. God punished them. 
-However the leader of the group that is the evil deacon is still alive. He convinced some members that these workers were “taken” by God while serving. 
-However this cannot be accepted as the punishment was done just as they wanted to distribute the holy communion which is considered holy and sacred. The punishment was quick and sudden. The evil deacon is still with the group of followers. How is it that God did not punish him still? 

-Rom 9: 22 What if God desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction. 
-The patience of God towards the one that is the object of 
God’s wrath and will allow him to continue his wickedness.  The sinners (vessels of wrath)  will be prepared for great destruction. 

-Rom 9:23 
-Everyone must fear the Lord. The church of God is a church of judgment and some judgment is immediate and some comes where at the end the eternal judgment is even greater.
