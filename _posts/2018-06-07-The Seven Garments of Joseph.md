-Joseph wore 7 garments. Each garment was given to him except 1
Gen 37:3-4 Joseph story began with this garment. This colourful garment was an honour and yet also caused his downfall. 

-This garment was given to him by his father to show his love towards him.

-However this caused jealousy and hate amongst his brothers towards him. 

-Today the father of Joseph is like our Heavenly father. The family of Joseph is likened to our family of brothers and sisters in Christ. 

-There are times when putting the colourful garment though it may be an honour or glorious but sometimes this will become a target of others’ criticism, hate and envy. It can also be a cause of pain and sufferings. 

-Gen 37:31-32 The second garment that Joseph wore was a robe dipped with blood. This garment was put on by his brother. He wore this because of love. What does this mean? 

-Who asked Joseph to find his brothers? It was his father and he was obedient and submissive to his father. He did not want his father to worry and proceeded to find his brothers. 

-When he was in the wilderness, he could have easily gotten lost and faced hunger and thirst. 

-Yet he proceeded on to find his brothers as he did not have a clue where actually was his brothers. 

-Finally when he found his brothers he was so happy. Yet at this time the brothers wanted to kill him. The garment dipped with blood was caused by his love towards his father and also love towards his brothers. 

- Sometimes we have to wear this “garment dipped with blood” whereby we need to sacrifice ourselves because we love. 

-Garment that Jesus wore is a garment of blood. It was white but then because he loved us and willing to die for us, he wore garment stained with his own precious blood. 

-Gen 39: 4-6 Joseph wore a garment made for slaves. Joseph was loyal and responsible as a slave. He had no choice as he was sold as a slave yet he did not habour any hate, any murmurings. He served his master wholeheartedly. 

-Sometimes we are unable to accomplish any small job because of our heart reject and refuse to do it. Joseph is different, he wore this garment of slavery with honour. He was loyal and responsible. 

-So much so that the master trusted Joseph in everything and put him in everything. He became an overseer for his master, Potiphar. 

-They are members whereby they gained honour and respect by members over the years. Then pride creeps in and start to exalt themselves.  There is no longer a servant to serve but expected to be serve. 

-We should always remind ourselves that we are a humble servant to serve. We need to be submissive, obedient and be humble to do whatever that God commands. 

- Gen 39:19-21 Joseph was sent to prison. He wore a prisoner garment. 

-This garment was put by his master, Potiphar caused by his wife’s deceit to accuse Joseph when he refused to sin against his master. His loyalty to his master caused him to be accused by his wife and was sent to prison. 

-He heeded to the teachings of God and he was god fearing yet this caused him to be imprisoned. 

-How could this be for someone that kept the commands of God yet be imprisoned? 

-Despite this, Joseph endured to the end and he continued to keep the commands of God. 

-When he was imprisoned he met 2 prisoners who dreamt. He interpreted both their dreams and all he told them that he was falsely accused. He reminded them that once they are out of prison, to remember him and inform the Pharoah so that he could be released. 

-In prison, he continued to serve in prison faithfully. He did not once murmur and blame God for his situation. He continued to trust and prayed to God accepting his situation with faith without murmurings. 

-If this happened to us will we be like Joseph? Are we able to withstand the trials of Joseph? This is something that we need to ponder. 

-Gen 41:42 This is the fifth garment – garment of fine linen not worn by himself but it was Pharaoh who put it on to Joseph.

-When Joseph wore this fine linen garment, this is the time in his phase of life when his worries, hardships, sufferings was over. This the greatest point of glory after overcoming all the trials in his life. 

-Gen 50: 1-3, 10-11 Joseph cried when his father died. His days of mourning was 70 days and after he came ot the threshing floor of Atad beyond Jordan, he continued to morn for his father for 7 days. At this time he was wearing a garment for mourning which is the sackcloth. 

-Gen 37:34 This sackcloth is worn to show deep grief and mourning.

-Joseph wore this sackcloth on his own to show his love for his father who passed away. 

-Gen 50:26 Joseph died being 100 years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. So his final garment was being embalmed by others who put it on him. 

-When we die and put on our final garment, what will the garment be? Will our spiritual garment able to lead us to heaven or our spiritual garment is so stained with sins that we are only to be condemned to hell. 

-Once we put this final garment, we will not be able to change our garment be it glorious that allows us to be with Jesus 
Christ or a garment of sin waiting for condemnation. 

-We all will come to the end of our lives. Do not be proud but to make sure we live a fruitful and glorious life in the Lord to await his second coming. 
All glory to God.
