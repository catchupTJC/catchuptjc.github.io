-Today’s sermon is touching the wonderful service by animal created by God which is the raven. 
-The raven was first used by Noah. At that time, Noah’s family was the only surviving family after the flood. Noah chose raven. However the first raven recorded  was a disappointment to Noah as the raven did not return to the ark. 

The ravens in the time of Elijah however performed a wonderful service for God which is worth our learning. 

-The raven fed Elijah during the great famine which at that time  there was no food. 
-1 Kings 17:1-7 In the time of Elijah was a time of darkness. The faith was deteriorating and the whole nation was worshipping idols. They also killed the prophets. 
-Not only the Israelites but also the king that was faithless. However only a remnant of  God’s servants were faithful. 
-Elijah was faithful and loyal towards God and took the role of rebuke the King and gave the warning of God to him. This took courage but Elijah was able to perform this duty. 
-Elijah like the workers of God needs to be trained by God. To be the servant of God need to be prepared to face trials. 
-How did God train Elijah? God asked him to hide himself by the brook of Cherith which is east of the Jordan. 
-This was after he accomplished a great thing. God wanted him to hide although he was at the peak of his service.  The timing is a form of training for Elijah. 
-The prophet Elijah was however, submissive to God and according to word of God, he went there to hide. 
-When we do divine work we need to be courageous, must have strong faith and also be submissive.
-Here, God asked the ravens to feed him. A great prophet like Elijah was even submissive and humble enough to accept that God chose ravens to feed him.  
-The reason was God wanted to train Elijah to be humble, submissive and to increase his faith.  
-Elijah prayed for fire and rain. This needed great faith to perform the 2 great miracles. Before he did this, God had to train him and taught him humble, submissive and faithful. 
-Elijah could see that even a raven could serve God faithfully what more about him?

-What are the things we can learn from the raven?
1) It is through the grace of God that God chose the raven to  serve God. This is grace as there is many other people more beautiful and capable yet we are able to serve God. 
2) Raven is black. Before we were baptized we were darkened with sin.
3) Raven can attack human beings. Although it is a bird it has a bad temper. The bible states that those who curse and not honour their parents are left in the forest to allow the raven to attack them. 
(Witnessing
A gangster always bring a knife with him as he was a criminal and fierce. He often like to challenge and quarrel with people. One day, his classmate who is a true jesus church member met him in the church. Later he too was baptized and was a totally transformation )
4) Raven like to eat foul things or decompose items. The things done in sin such as unholiness, fights, quarrels, strife etc. 
5) Raven sounds noisy.   
Yet God chose the raven despite all the above characteristics. 

This raven was diligent in feeding Elijah. It brought bread and meat in the morning and evening. We must be diligent doing the work of God. Whether smooth sailing or not we need to continue to serve the Lord. Just like in Elijah, the raven fed the prophet until the brook dried up. We must continue to serve God until we die. 

3) Raven actually seize the opportunity to serve. 
Elijah will not remain there and the water in the brook will not be there forever. 
When there is still opportunity to serve we need to seize it as long as we are called to serve. 
-In doing divine work, when the church needs you, that this opportunity to serve. 

-It was not an easy task for raven to find food –bread and meat during the time of famine and drought.  So God gave the raven a challenging and difficult task. 

-The second problem for the raven is where to search for the food as the famine affects the whole land of Israel. Could it be at the palace of the king? Or flew another far distance place? No one knows. 
-Finding food by the raven face dangerous situations in searching food. The raven has to feed Elijah in the morning and evening.
-6th wonderful service. The raven when it did this work faced temptations. The temptation is daily. The raven had to use its beak to take the meat and bread and this itself is so tempting for the raven to eat it itself.
-Ravens are used by God. So it is not only one raven but many ravens  which did this work.  
-In church members need to work together to do the service of God. 
-The ravens could finished the work of God to achieve a beautiful service. 
-The ravens are very clear of their roles and responsibilities. They knew that they had to ensure the prophets enough meat and bread. 
-Today we need to know clearly our roles and responsibilities. Are we clear what we need to do to serve God. 
-Doing the work of God indeed have good reward. God will also provide food to the ravens during the time of famine and it received blessings and are protected by God to receive peace.
