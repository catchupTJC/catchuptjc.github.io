-The Holy Communion is a sacred covenant for the children of God. He has shown Himself to us that we may know Him.

-God also shares plenty of testimonies. 
-1Cor 5: 7-8
-Here speaks of the Passover. Get rid of the old yeast and make a new batch without yeast (sin).
-Here describes Jesus as the Passover lamb that was sacrificed for our sake.

-As Jesus once sacrificed His body for us, we should maintain the faith by being without leaven (sin).

-We should from time to time inspect ourselves – have we become too worldly? 
-John 1: 29
-Here speaks John the Baptist testifying about Jesus being the sacrificial Lamb of God. This words were spoken immediately when John met Jesus and His disciples.

-1 Cor 11: 23-24
-Here speaks of the Lord broke bread the night before He was betrayed. It was at this very moment the act of the Holy Communion was established with Jesus and His disciples.

-Our faith in Jesus must be backed with the support of His words. We will need to thoroughly understand the teachings of Jesus in any circumstance.

-Also to take note, Jesus uttered in the verse “this is my body”. It wasn’t a representation but rather literal in a spiritual sense.

-If we were to consume the body of Christ, that it would be considered transgression
-1Cor 11: 27
-Those who partake in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

-Verse 30-31
-If we were to judge ourselves rightly, we will not be judged - the Lord is merciful.

-What would happen to the leftovers from the Holy Communion?
-Exodus 12: 10
-Do not leave it till morning. If there are leftovers, they must be burned – the understanding here is that as long as the leftovers weren’t deliberate, God understands and provides a way to resolve it.

-So why burn the leftovers? Isn’t it a bit too much?
-If this Passover lamb is burned it has to undergo pain once more – this is the price of carelessness
