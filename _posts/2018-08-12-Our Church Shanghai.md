-The condition in China is that anyone less than 18 years old cannot enter a church. Each church will have a CCTV which is connected in the central government office. They will check their ID before allowing them to go to church. As such there is no Religious education classes. At that age of 18 and above, their belief is without God. 
-The government has also imprisoned 2 of their China deacons and many ministers of deacons has also gone there to assist. 
-The persecution of the government towards the church is great. 
-The class conducted by Pr Chin is towards the tertiary students and young youths just working and they were eager to seek the truth. 
-The church is now airconditioned and also they have hostel facilities unlike 2 years ago. The students turned the aircon in the hostel as well as the church hall and there was an explosion. They ask the electrician to come but he was drunk and insisted to come to repair and instead of repairing he made it worse and almost short circuited himself. 
-At that time, the deacon was praying and praise God he did not die. At that time there were 70-80 of the students from all over China and that is illegal. 
-The 1 government official and 2 policemen came and the deacon took them to his house, to the restaurant and drank with them so that they later did not come in and allowed the deacon to just fill the form himself which was their normal inspection. 
-1 Thess 1:2-3
There were 3 that was thankful for
1) Their love
2) Their faith
3) Their hope. 
Many churches in China move us because of the 3 things above. 
In Shanghai there are 7 churches. 2 churches are shared with other churches in the city of Shanghai. The church building belongs to the outside church. Our Sabbath is on Saturday and allow us to use 9-5pm there are 500 people. There is only one service on Saturday. Pastors from other church will criticize and make trouble eg blaming the TJC on the benches that is spoilt, criticizing that TJC members do not respect the church allowing members to eat. 
-TJC started to build own church in the outskirts. Also have prayer houses. 
-There are about 500 members 
-During the building of the TJC church, the wall that was already built, there were opposition and they would destroy it for 5 times. On the 6th time they did not bother again when the TJC members rebuilt the wall again. The members and ministers were patient and continued to give way to them. 
-Gen 26:18-22 This reminded the incident that Isaac endured whereby his well was taken away by the Philistine. He did not fight with them and just continued to give way. So he did this for 3 times. 
- The church was surrounded by the gentiles and the wisdom by the ministers and members showed maturity and patience. In not fighting back, this helped in creating a harmonious environment. If this was not handled properly and there is a serious conflict, in long term it will not help the situation. 
Praise God there were with wisdom to resolve the problem. Now the services is held in peace. 

2) Our God is someone that gives you peace . 
Phil 4:6-7
There is a deacon in the church who opened a big gold shop. There was a customer who came to the shop and after talking to the customer he felt dizzy and gave all the gold and jewelleries to him. When the brother was conscious, this is the work of the evil as how can you just give the jewelleries to a stranger. He prayed to God to ask God to bring back the gold and jewelleries. Every day he prayed for 3 days and later the man quickly brought back the jewelleries and drop the bag of jewelleries to him and ran away. As he chased after him, he called Hallelujah and the thief turned his head and also called Hallelujah. When he went through the bag, he got all the jewelleries and gold and none was missing. 
-This is similar to the incident recorded in the bible in Genesis where God rebuked the opposition of Jacob. 

3) Another believer also open a gold shop. There is a place called Hui Han and it is the cleanest city in China. He has a 5 storey building so the 1st 3 storey is for him to sell gold but the 4th and 5th is to offer for church use. 
-2 robbers came and left a bundle of gold and gold bars on the table but the thieves took the small gold and did not take the more expensive ones. She kept on saying hallelujah and God really protected them and the losses were small.

4) There was a an unbeliever whose sister is a church member. His sister passed away and he felt believing Jesus is no use. There is no hope in believing in Jesus or God. He also blamed that if Jesus is God, then his sister will not die. As he was thinking about this, he had a dream. He dreamt that he was in heaven and saw his sister. His sister told him that she was very happy here. There was a young man there and he said that he knew this unbeliever and is the same village near the house. He told him to tell his father that he is happy here and ask him not to be sad. The unbeliever ask the address of the young man and also the phone number. Then he woke up from his dream. He thought himself if this dream is true, then if I find this place, then the dream is true. With the address and telephone number he actually found the house of the young man. Then a 60 year old man came out and was the father of the young man. The unbeliever said that your son ask me to come to look for you. The father said, “My son is dead, what are you talking about?” Then the unbeliever told the young man’s father is a deacon of the church about the dream he had and the passing of the sister. The deacon then knew that it was God’s will to preach to this unbeliever and he later became baptized. This testimony was the unbeliever that there is hope in believing Jesus and he later became a believer. 
-Lk 23:42-43
-This is our hope of believing in Jesus. 

5) Jesus strengthened the faith of the church through a 80 year old man. 
 -When he was sick, after laying hands, he was healed. When he herd someone sick, he will walk to the believer house and pray for them. He has full of love and later this touch Jesus and gave him a gift of healing. Later each time when he prayed for someone, the person was healed. This gift was discovered. Today we are selfish, lazy, did not pray for others and just stay at home to do our own things. Jesus do not give us the gifts as we do not use the gift for God use. Some has the gift to speak but keep on pushing away the duty. 
-this 80 man taking a torch light will walk to sick members house to care and love and pray for others. He has been taken by the lord but the example he left was worth emulate and all members follow his good example. 
Would we follow his example of love. 

6) There was a sister’s husband who had an operation. The sister accompany the husband to take care of him. When Pr Chin was there, he was one whole month continuously had religious training. The persecution is so great so they want to seize the opportunity to train. They still have the opportunity to do so. So their program is continuous batch after batch. At this time is very hot at 37-38 C and the students are obedient and eager to learn. The church ask the sister to help out in church even though they knew that her husband is sick in the hospital. She told her husband that she need to cook for the church for 3 days and told her that Jesus will look after you and you need to take care of yourself. In this country our family is blissful,there is peace and our faith has deteriorated and the faith of the China members has exceeded us in terms of love, faith and hope. 

7) There is an old sister about 80 years old. Dn Huang drove 2 hours to help in the church. The old sister sitting in his car kept on encouraging him saying words of thanks and appreciation, to persevere and continue to serve the Lord. Later the members in the church  told him that this old lady walk 2 hours to go to church. This really touched the deacon as he has the comfort of the car driving 2 hours in aircon while this old sister’s faith and love endure even more walking to church 2 hours just to go to church for worship.
