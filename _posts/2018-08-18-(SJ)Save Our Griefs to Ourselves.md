How do we deal with grief? By expressing it to others or soldier it on alone?
-	Patience and perseverance is the key 

The Chinese character for grief is formed with ‘trouble’ placed above the ‘heart’.
-	Grief is formed by evil intentions
-	However, grief can also build character

Romans 15: 1-3
-	In times where we pursue our own selfish desires, we could indirectly do it over the well-being of others.
-	Instead, it should be the opposite – pleasing others above ourselves
-	The passage reads “for even Christ did not please himself..”

-Merely attending church services isn’t an indication of how religious a person is – its how we manifest His teachings in our daily lives.

-The faith of Abraham was one that suffered grief alone and in return, spread happiness to others. 
Gen 13: 6
Lot and Abraham had disputes due to having too many possessions, not because they were in poverty.
Quarreling over riches is worse than that of a poor man.
-	The poor would argue over spending matters and is usually trivial in value
-	The rich would argue over significant amounts of wealth which could potentially lead to murder


-Verse 14
Suffering lost is only a gain. After Lot departed from Abraham, the Lord offered Abraham vast amounts of land for him and his offsprings. 

-At what occasions do we save grievances to ourselves? – when we are slandered


-Numbers 12: 1-2
Moses’ own brothers and sisters talked ill of him. Their real motives were revealed in verse 2 when it writes “hasn’t the Lord also spoken through us and not just Moses”.

-There are times when certain trivial arguments are precursors to larger dissatisfaction.

-Moses didn’t quarrel or react to their statements – he was a humble man and contained the grievances within himself.
-In verse 4, the Lord spoke to Moses, Miriam and Aaron. Here shows the Lord reassuring His people that He is with them.
-Sometimes, in order to prevent arguments from blowing out of proportion we must learn to keep grievances to ourselves.

-No matter how much we are being unfairly accused, always remember that God is watching over us.

-2 Cor 12: 15-16
Paul had a deep love for the church of Corinth. Although he was accused of being a crafty fellow for tricking them, Paul didn’t express his grief – he had sincere love for the church.

-“If I love you more, will you love me less?”

-1 Cor 4: 3
I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court. Paul’s accountability is with the Lord. He continues to serve despite being wrongly accused.

-Prov 17: 25
A foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to his mother. Foolish isn’t the inability to think but rather viewing himself as wise in his own eyes.
