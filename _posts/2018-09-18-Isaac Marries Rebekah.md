Genesis 24
Abraham was aware of the presence in Rebekah and disallowed of their marriage – insisting that God has other plans for Isaac.

Is/Was our marriage pleasing in the eyes of the Lord?

Gen 24: 67
Here speaks of the marriage between Isaac and Rebekah.
There are two ways of love; matchmaking (Isaac) or by one’s choice (Jacob)
Most of us would opt for the latte for the freedom of choice.

Matchmaking would be in the form of the church’s network and is still left to the choice of the individual to pursue.

Coming back to the earlier passage, Isaac deeply loved Rebekah and this helped with her assimilation to the family.

Hebrews 13: 4
Here mentions not to defile the bed before marriage and have affairs once wed-locked. It means here that after marriage, we aren’t allowed to divorce.

Society however, shows otherwise given that it is common practice these days. 
Marriages within the church will in fact strengthen the church whereas the opposite would most likely leave to broken ones.

Allow time to spend with your significant other – to communicate. If your other half has disappointed you, it is important to be honest. 

Practice patience and not to be quick to criticize one another. Be aware of the situation and know what should be said and left unsaid.

2) To Compromise
As a couple, making mutual decisions are inevitable. How are these decisions made? Does one dominate discussion over the other or is it via tolerance and compromise?

3) Learn to apologize
There is strength in admitting your own wrong doings. It is important to apologize wholeheartedly.

4) Reminders of how important the other person is to you
Declaration of affection is something that we need to get used to. To love your other half is to love yourself.

Ephesians 5: 25
Husband love your wives as the Lord has loved the church.

Maintaining a marriage is equally if not more difficult that it is to start one. When there is a problem, resolve it immediately – the sooner the better.

The church is a mixture of single, married and empty nesters (parents with adult or married children). 

For empty nesters, a change of mindset is required
1)	To understand that the children are no longer the center of attention – couples would have significantly more unexpected time with each other.

Be more accepting, caring & rational (decisive). These are the qualities that can only be balanced by each halves. 

2)	Communicate more to maintain the relationship.
 It is not to inflict harm to one another. Ensure that the communication are constructive rather than destructive.

Also, acknowledge that you aren’t the same as you were back in your youth. Learn to take better care of yourself.
