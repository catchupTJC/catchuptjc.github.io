It is a heartwarming story of love. As we go through life, we must learn to walk it according to the Bible. In previous sermons, how to walk through the valley of the shadow of death was discussed; how if we live with hope, we can rid depression. Because depression is hopelessness but knowing Christ is hope. Previous sermons also talked about the narrow path - not going too far to the right or left. Following the Bible, we won’t be too sinful or over righteous/self-righteous. We don’t put unnecessary restrictions or place a ‘higher’ morality on ourselves (e.g. veganism).

A person with faith will have a different perspective of life. When guided by faith, we know what’s a spiritual reality and walk accordingly. Hope. Faith. And of course the greatest of this in love. 

In our life, we also ought to walk in love. 
1 Cor 13:4-7
What is love? When faith was defined, examples were provided in Heb 11. It would be nice to have examples to better understand love too.

So we turn to the stories of Joseph and Jacob.
Gen 37:32-25
In this story, we read about fathers/parents, a son/child, a brother/sibling. We at least occupy 2 out of 3 roles (unless you’re an only child). These roles are common to us. 

We read of the tears of a parent who had lost a child. His grief was immense. Even when his wife Rachel died, it did not record of such a grief. 

Gen 35:19-20
There was no record of Jacob mourning like he did for Joseph. There are many kinds of love. But the love of a parent for a child is immense. If you’re at funerals, the ones where there’s the most crying is when a child has died. Everyday when you wake up and see your children with you, you ought to thank God. 

What do we do if our child is lost? How do we cope with such grief?

Another story that tugs at the heartstrings is in 2 Kings 4:14-37. This was about the Shunammite woman who was kind to Elisha. She got a child but he died. The story ends well, the child revives. (read all the verses)

We can see how devastated the woman was. We can also see how she relied on God. She believed Elisha was a man of God who could do miracles. We can ask God to revive our child physically. Spiritually too. Sometimes we may lose our child spiritually. Our child strays from the truth. We pray. We grieve for the child. We can ask the Lord to revive their faith. This is very important because as a parent we should grieve when our child is lost. That’s how Jacob grieved. Sometimes the death of a child is the will of God. 

1 Kings 14:1-2, 13
The child of Abijah died. The reason was because there was found something good in him whereas the rest were wicked.
We can, if we are in the will of God, accept the death of a child. This was one of the speaker’s greatest fears when his children were growing up. But we should prepare for this. Young people should also prepare their faith for this. 

We return to the story. Joseph went to Egypt, became a slave, rose and then was sent to prison. He interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams and was raised to be a Prime Minister. All this time, we don’t read about Joseph shedding tears despite going through a lot. Tough boy. 

Gen 41:51-5
Joseph named his first name Manasseh which means to forget 1. His sufferings 2. his father’s house. 
Many people misunderstand Joseph. They think that he was trying to forget all that his brothers had done to him; to forget about the need for revenge. But the Bible does not say so. It says that he wanted to forget his father’s house. Some of you have not lived overseas. The speaker was from Malaysia and came to Singapore to study. He was overseas while his family was in Malaysia. One would think of one’s family. There’re some people studying overseas who are very homesick. So when people say they want to forget their father’s house, it’s not to forget the bad things, it’s to forget the good things. Because you want to go back. The speaker had to stay in Singapore because he had to study. Remember Joseph was a very powerful man. Was he really really not able to go back to get his father?

What is love? Love does not seek its own. Love suffers long and is kind. Love bears all things. If Joseph were to go back, there would be big trouble at home. Jacob would be shocked! He’d be so angry with the other sons. The brothers would be all shocked. They may just scatter and run away. The family would be broken. That is the more likely scenario. That’s why he needed to forget the goodness of his father’s house. Because he could not go back. He was not sure whether his brothers still harboured hatred towards him. 

This is really a tear jerker kind of story. Because for any story to be a good tear jerker, there needs to be a misunderstanding. One person suffering for another who has no idea. And then all of us watching the movie: “Ahh why doesn’t he just tell him?!”

Joseph was like that. He couldn’t go back. So he stayed in Egypt. He longed for his father and brother, especially Benjamin. When we do good things, God views us kindly. And God gave Joseph consolation. He gave him a family in Egypt. Joseph was a great man. He always thought about others. But he was often misunderstood. When he told about his dream, cynics even today who read the Bible say that Joseph was very proud. A small boy who talked so much. That doesn’t make sense. Why would Joseph be proud for telling a dream God gave him? If he didn’t tell the dream, how would we know the things that happened came from the power of God. 

Joseph was a great man. He always thought about others. Even in Egypt he thought of the solution to the problem of 7 years plenty and 7 years famine. He saved millions of people by the wisdom that God gave him. 

He always cared about others. 

Now the brothers came to Egypt. After 7 years of good harvest and 2 years of famine, the people of Canaan were really suffering. Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to get food. 

Gen 42
Joseph recognised them and accused them of being spies. He put them all in prison for 3 days. To prove that they were spies, he told them to bring their youngest brother the next time they came. 
v21-24 (read)
First record of Joseph weeping. When his brothers first came, he was strict with them. Let’s now try to understand why he would cry when he heard what they said. What sought of person would cry?

The speaker thinks his grief was incurred because they had a sense of guilt. Probably he thought his brothers were incorrigible. What kind of people would throw their brother into a pit just because they told them his dream and because of the colourful cloak. And sell him to Egypt! And lie to the father and make the father cry for days and days. So in his mind, his brothers were really bad guys. But he wasn’t seeking revenge. A person with love does not seek his own. “Ok. They’re like that. If I go back, trouble. So I won’t go back.” 

Now he hears that they’re guilty, repentant and sad about what they did. Tears welled up because of all those wasted years. “My brothers are not that bad. I could’ve gone home. What a waste.” But he wasn’t sure. So he did some more testing of his brothers. 

Now we go back to Jacob. The brothers went back and told Jacob this guy in Egypt wants them to bring Benjamin with them the next time round. 

Gen 42:36-38
Jacob was stunned and afraid to lose Benjamin too. “If that happens, I’ll die!” he said straightaway. But he also cared for Simeon (v36). He cared for all his children. All of us as children must realise our parents love us. The problem of sibling rivalry is when we think our parents love one more. Is it true? Actually it is lol. Jacob loved Joseph most. Benjamin second most.
Love does not seek its own. If we think our parents love us a little bit less than our brother justifies us hating our parents or hating our brother, then you don’t have love. We should appreciate the love our parents give us. Because they’re human. It’s not possible to equally divide their love. Furthermore we should also take a look at ourselves. Maybe we’re the super naughty one. Of course if we know the extreme case, Reuben did something super horrible, he slept with his father’s concubine. Simeon and Levi murderer one whole group of people. When we look at ourselves we may notice we’re not so lovable but our father still loves us. We should appreciate. We will be loved if we don’t work too hard at it. Just be nice. You’re independent. You’re courteous. You’re cute. Somehow your parents will love you even more. Of course as parents we try our best to be equal. 

But what can the speaker say, he only has one son and one daughter so he can say, “You’re my favourite son!” “You’re my favourite daughter!”

But let us learn all parents love their children, and Jacob loved his children. 

Now we go back to the story. There was no choice. The famine grew stronger and they had to return once more to Egypt for food and with Benjamin. Joseph tried all he could to check if his brothers had really changed. 
Gen 43:27-31 (read)
Joseph asked them about their well-being and asked whether their father was well and alive. They said their father was well and alive. 
Joseph managed to control himself when he heRd about his father. But couldn’t tahan anymore when he saw his brother Benjamin and had to excuse himself to cry. 

They say heroes don’t cry. The speaker remembers how his primary school was a tough school. There were some naughty kids. The discipline master would catch and cane them on their hands. There was a really tough guy. He was caned 10-20 times. Finally the pain was too much and one tear came out. His accomplice was next. After one caning, he burst into tears. And the caning stopped. Who’s the real hero lol

It’s true! Heroes don’t shed tears for their own sufferings. And Joseph was a hero. Heroes shed tears of love. Joseph really loved his brother Benjamin. There was a deep longing and it was all restrained. 

Then what happened?
Joseph entrapped Benjamin with a silver cup and threatened to imprison Benjamin and send the other brothers home.

Gen 44:18
Hero of the day was Judah! The ancestor of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
(Read)
Judah has achieved the love of God. Love does not envy. No longer did Judah envy the brother that was loved more by his father. In the beginning he was envious of Joseph. He couldn’t stand it. But now he could speak freely of his father’s special love for Benjamin and not be envious. Because he himself now had love. 

v21-34
Judah’s speech went on and on. (Read)
v33-34
Now Judah is sacrificing himself. 

Love does not seek its own. Love bears all things. Love endures all things. Without love, Judah could not do this. 

Remember Judah is the ancestor of Jesus. Of course Jesus is God. And Jesus because of love endured all things. He sacrificed Himself for us. 

Gen 45:1
Joseph’s crying was so loud, all the house of Pharaoh heard it. Tears of relief. All is well. These were tears of joy. The Bible says we should rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. But sometimes these both come together because we have tears of joy. 

These tears were tears of joy. All is well. His brothers are ok. Now he could see his father again. 

Joseph was really the proper big brother. 

v24 “See that you do not become troubled along the way.” 
He was the acknowledged benevolent leader. He was the leader by necessity in the will of God. God had put him there to save the whole family. He never wanted to boss his brothers around. But when necessary, he had to take the lead. Even by giving friendly advice “don’t fight when you go back ah” 

v26 They told this good news to Jacob when they got back. Jacob was stunned. “Joseph is alive and is governor of all of Egypt!” Jacob STOOD STILL. If we followed the story likely we’d also be stunned “He’s alive!”

v27 read
When we have hope, life is good and meaningful. 

When Joseph was presumed dead, everything turned dark. But Jacob wasn’t down in the dumps to never came up again because he had God. But with this new hope his life became brighter. 

Perhaps we have a tragedy in our life. We have a loss. But we have God. Sometimes things turn out better than we hope. We may lose something and gain two other things. 

We have members who have lost their child through cancer at an early age. Because of their child, their faith was revived; they used to be not so regular in church. After that God gave them 3 other children. 

Faith in God is a good thing. Our lives are much better. But we have to maintain also the love that is described here. 

Gen 46:29-30
Read
They wept a long long time. The greatest thing: to see someone you had thought lost. Sometimes we see old friends. And they’re still in church! (The speaker has lost friends of old and they’re no longer in church) 

It’s the greatest thing to see a lost one or someone you haven’t seen in a long while. Now Jacob had no more regrets in life. He wept. 

Gen 50:1-11
The years passed. Jacob lived a good number of years after he reunited with Joseph. Even though he professed he was ready to die at reunion, he still lived many years. Finally he died. Joseph wept for his father. 70 days in Egypt. Another 7 days in Canaan. 

Sometimes we misunderstand what it means to weep for a lost one. Some people say “as Christians we should not cry!” “As Christians we just get the funeral over with quickly.” “As Christians, aiya don’t care where my body is put lah just faster burn and throw into the sea.”

Let’s take reference from the Bible rather than have our own interpretation. From here we see we can mourn for the dead. If we love someone, we can be sad we won’t see the person again. Yes we have hope we will meet again in heaven. If it’s ok for us to cry when our child leaves overseas to study for 2 years, why not at the funeral? We can cry. We don’t grieve until we’re crazy. 

Joseph mourned for his father. 

In conclusion, let us love our family with the love of Joseph and Jacob. An unselfish love. Truthful. Sacrificial. Preferring harmony to insisting on one’s own way. Joseph had all these aspects of love. 

We turn back to 1 Cor 13 and read the same passage. Let’s reflect on the tears of Joseph and seek to emulate this love in our lives. 
1 Cor 13:4-7
Love suffers long and is kind. Joseph suffered for a long time. He was willing to not go home for the sake of harmony.

Love does not envy. From Joseph even to Judah. 

Love does not parade itself, is not puffed up. Does not behave rudely. Does not seek its own. Is not provoked. Thinks no evil. 
This sermon didn’t refer to the famous verses in Gen 50 where his father died and his brothers thought he would take revenge. Joseph cried. Because Joseph himself doesn’t think such evil things. 

Does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth. Bears all things. Believes all things. Hopes all things. Endures all things.
