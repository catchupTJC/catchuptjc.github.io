Eph 4:1, 2 Tim 1:8 (read)  
In these two verses, Paul addresses himself as the prisoner of Jesus Christ. The Chinese translation for Eph 4:1 states that Paul was a prisoner FOR Christ. But in the original text or the English translation, Paul says he’s a prisoner OF Christ. 

The two epistles were written from the prison in Rome. Ephesians was written in his first imprisonment. 2 Tim was written in his final/second imprisonment.

Paul was in prison for Christ because he hadn’t committed any wrong. He preached the gospel. He did righteousness. Yet was put in prison just as they persecuted Jesus Christ and His disciples. Just as they crucified Jesus, Paul and Peter were executed. Paul was in prison for Christ, but from the two verses, he wasn’t talking about being in prison, he was talking about his life of faith. In his belief for Jesus, he had surrendered his lordship of life to the lord, becoming a servant of God. He sacrificed his freedom so he could accomplish the will of God, finishing the ministry of Jesus Christ. By surrendering his lordship, he made Jesus Christ his Lord, consequently becoming Jesus Christ’s prisoner. 

Rom 6:16-18, 22  
This epistle was written to the Romans who were once pagans who worshipped the sun, and had many gods in their midst. Their lives were full of lusts and licentiousness. Their lives were full of sin. But believing in Jesus Christ set them free from the bondage of sin. Through the grace of the blood of Jesus Christ, they became slaves of God. This allowed them to bear fruits of holiness to have everlasting life at the end. 

A prisoner of Jesus Christ can be said to be a slave of righteousness because Jesus Christ lives in him. No longer is he a slave of sin. Paul was a prisoner of Jesus Christ. It’s not that he wasn’t free. Rather, he gave up this freedom so that he no longer lived for himself but Christ lived in him. 

Gal 2:20  
Why was Paul so willing to be Jesus Christ’s prisoner? Because Jesus loved him. Because Jesus died for him. Because Jesus is the almighty God incarnated to die for him. Paul felt this love immensely. This is when he placed his life in the almighty hands of God. This allowed Paul to proclaim, “It is no longer I who lives, but Christ who lives in me.”  
Eventually, he died as a martyr for Jesus. No one would want to die as a martyr, but a Christian willing to live and die for Christ will be able to take it. 

This is a momentary affliction. Sometimes we feel it is too much to bear and  
And then when we’re blessed with riches and success, we forget to give thanks to God. But Paul understood everything was in the almighty hands of God. He WAS persecuted, going through much persecutions, perhaps much more than anybody else. He carried a thorn in his flesh. Despite praying thrice for its removal, Jesus said, “My grace is sufficient for you.” The thorn was attributed to the Satan’s messenger’s buffet (2 Cor 12:7-9). Even though the thorn was given by the evil one, God allowed it lest Paul be too elated in his successes. Since it was the will of Christ for him, Paul leading to take pleasure in it. 

Not everything we touch turns to gold. Not everyone who believes in Christ will not be sick at all. Not everyone who believes in Christ who meets a terrible death is a sinner. He could’ve been a very righteous person. But if it’s the will of God, he dies according to that. No matter how horrific the death, he rests in Jesus Christ. 

Paul understood all this. Hence he was a prisoner of the Lord who lived and died for Christ. We need to learn this in our life of faith. Much as we hope our life will be comfortable, full of peace, devoid of sufferings and pain, not many of us will experience this unless we’re given special grace. 

It is through many tribulations that we’ll enter the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the narrow path we tread. If we submit ourselves to be God’s prisoner, we will be victorious at the end. 

Phil 1:20-25  
This epistle was written by Paul from his first imprisonment in Rome. By that time, he had accomplished 3 ministries and gone through many many suffering for Christ. He was imprisoned in Cilicia for 3 years. Sent on a ship for Caesarea to Rome as a prisoner. On the voyage, there was a shipwreck. But God protected Paul and the rest. In Rome’s prison, Paul tried to preach to the Jews - the people - none of them believed. 

So when he wrote this letter, he opined being taken away by the Lord was far better, his suffering would end. But he knew he has to live for Christ. Only by living for Christ could he die for Christ(?), and that would be gain. If he suffered for God, his suffering would bring benefits to the brethren.

Paul didn’t say, “Take me away! I want to die!” He said, “If it’s Your will, take me away. If You want me to live, I’ll live for You. If You want to take me away, I’ll go.” 

We can’t choose the day we die, or the way we die. Some of us die in our sleep (that’s the best!). Some of us die from old age. Some of us may not die when we’re 100 but perhaps die next year or in 10 years time. Whatever it is, we must live and die for Christ, by presenting the lordship of our lives to Jesus Christ. 

Paul devotes his whole life to serve God. Consequently, he was martyred for God. 

Rom 15:15-24  
Another point on how Paul was a prisoner of Jesus Christ.  
When Paul preached the gospel, he spoke not his own teaching (v18). Whatever he did and spoke was what the Lord wanted. The places he planned to go - Rome and Spain - was the Lord’s will. Then, they didn’t know the Earth was flat and reckoned Spain was the end of the earth. That’s why he wanted to go to Spain.  
Paul also wanted to go to Rome even though there were already some people preaching there. He wanted to preach to more people! And also gather more support for the mission in Spain.

Today when we do the work of God, we have many plans. But are the plans fully in accordance to the will of God. 

When the speaker visited a sister stricken with stroke, her friend from another church was feeding her. He looked so joyful! He had come for our evangelistic service before. Upon witnessing this act of love, the speaker felt he had not done enough of what the Lord wanted him to do. He feels he cannot call himself a prisoner of Christ. 

Paul could. Because he totally did what the Lord wanted him to do. He was totally devoted to the ministry of God. He wasn’t doing what he wanted to do for Christ, but what Christ wanted him to do. 

Acts 21:11-14, 20:24  
Prophet Agabus prophesied that Paul would be bound and delivered into the hands of the Gentiles by the Jews at Jerusalem. Those with him pled for him not to go. But Paul said he had to go because it was the will of God and was willing to even die at Jerusalem. He didn’t consider his life as precious, for the sake of Christ. He truly considered himself as a prisoner of the Lord. 

Such a spirit is important to do world evangelism. There are preachers who go Myanmar, Africa, South America to evangelise. But few. The spirit of the church currently is to evade suffering. Hence few of us are willing to do this. 

A US couple were moved to go to Yemen to preached the gospel. Christians were beheaded there. They entered as ‘volunteers’ but suffered very much. No one believed. Coming back to the US, they told their children that they would be going again because it was the will of God to preach to the ends of the earth. Today there are a few Christians in Yemen; there are now 3 churches. The gospel they preached wasn’t the truth, but their spirit is admirable. We too can be moved by God’s love to accomplish such works. 

I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith  
• Kept the faith  
1 Tim 6:12  
English: good fight of faith  
Chinese: good fight of the truth  
We are fighting this battle of the word of God against false teachings. Each of us have to fight this battle because only the truth in us will save us. Only by keeping ourselves in the truth can we be saved. Many have lost this truth halfway. Some are misled by others. Some utilise their own intelligence to work out the truth and go astray. Many false teachings have arisen.

During Paul’s time, he had to fight against the Jewish teachers who still insisted on the things of the law - keeping the feasts, circumcision, etc. It wasn’t that the law wasn’t right, but that Jesus had already fulfilled those aspects of the law. It was ironic the Jewish teachers keep the Old Testament but taught teachings that could not save. 

Gal 1:8-9  
“If anyone (even if it’s an angel) preaches another gospel to you, let him be accursed!”

Today many are followers of men and not Christ. That’s why Paul urged to fight the fight of faith, against heretical teachings. He even rebuked Peter for separating himself from the Gentiles. It’s not easy. It’s better to keep quiet; you won’t hurt people and people won’t hurt you. There won’t be consequences. But Paul was different, and fought the good fight of faith. This is what the True Jesus Church should do. We need to be careful that the truth handled down by the Holy Spirit gets changed. Each of us needs to reject and oppose those who speak deviant teachings, even if they may appear as angels of light. Pray to discern between false teachers and those from the Lord. 

• Finished the race  
1 Cor 9:24-27  
The race Paul finished was the race of preaching the gospel. This is the race Jesus had set for him to preach for the gentile lands. While Peter was the apostle to the Jews, Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles. After 3 missionary journeys and an imprisonment, Paul still continued to preach because he knew he hadn’t finished running the race yet.

Paul also took heed lest he got disqualified. A person who preaches the gospel but doesn’t keep the gospel, committing sin, surely will not gain the prize. The winner of this race is one that runs according to the rules set by the Lord. 

Some of us have to run 100m, some 400m, some 1000m. A good preacher - dynamic in speech, efficient in counselling - served for 1 year and died. Such was his race. Other preachers serve for 50+ years. Such is their race. One preacher suffered a stroke and passed after 10 years of suffering. Another suffered a stroke and passed the next day. Such are their races.

Paul ran his race with all his might, preaching the gospel to the ends of the earth. 

The True Jesus Church is very blessed. It has the truth, it has many people who can preach the truth. The youths sometimes speak sermons comparable to deacons and preachers. In Singapore, the work is lacking. How many of us go around the whole island preaching? Many of us have pastoral skills. How many of us are taking care of one another?

If we don’t buck up, by the time the Lord takes us away, how can we say we have finished the race? How can we claim the crown of righteousness?

• I have kept the faith (in Chinese: I have kept the word)  
As we do the work and preach and take care of people, can WE OURSELVES be saved? Don’t say: “I’ve been in the church for 30 years! How can I not be saved?” “I’m a preacher/deacon, how can I err?”

Don’t be so sure. If not for the grace of God, we could easily fall. 

Paul, the prisoner of Christ, kept the faith/word to the end, and attributes this to the grace of God. His mentions of being the chief of sinners reflects this. 

Remain faithful to the word of God. In the end times, the speaker fears we will begin to relax; we don’t consider our life of faith so much. If we don’t diligently serve God, don’t diligently keep His word, we cannot like Paul say that a crown of righteousness awaits us. Paul never allowed his desire to control him, but allowed the love of Christ control him. This enables him to live and die for Christ. May we all strive to do this too.
