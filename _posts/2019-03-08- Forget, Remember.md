Deuteronomy 6:1-3
They will write down the will as the next instruction for the next generation.
Hebrews 13:15-16
If we love God but we do not love our brothers and sisters, then it is like where there is faith but without works is death.
In our life, who can we not forget even until the day we die?
First is the person who always helps us and another is the person that left the negative impression to us the most.
3 people that we cannot forget
-1 Kings 2:5-Joab, commander of the Israel army, he killed 2 of David’s men as he wanted revenge.
-1 Kings 2:7-Shimei
-1 Kings 2:8-Basilai
David fled barefoot, because of his sins, his kingdom would be destroyed.
David became king again and forgave his men.
Do we only praise someone when they are at their best, when they have power to reign?
We are easily hurt. We should forget about the bad things that people had done to us.
Colossians 3:13
We should forgive others as God has died on the cross for us to forgive our sins.
When Joseph was sold by his brothers to other people, Joseph did not feel any hatred as he understood that it was God’s will.
2 Kings 6:17
We as humans, we are always afraid of illnesses.
We should not forget our responsibilities.
1 Kings 19:4
When we have disappointments, we will start grumbling.
We also forget about our responsibilities.
We should also think before we get involved in an activity as it will give a bad impression as a TJC member to others.
Think before we act.
1 Kings 18:12-13
When we are doing things alone, we will definitely face a crossroad in life where there will be obstacles as not everything will be smooth sailing.
Revelations 20:15
Whether we forget or remember, the most important thing is that our name is in the Book of Life.
