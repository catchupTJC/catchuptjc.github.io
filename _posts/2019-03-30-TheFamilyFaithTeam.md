2 Chron 29 talks about how Hezekiah led a team of Levites to lead the hearts of the people back to God. We can take faith that he lived in an ungodly generation where his father led the people to worship idols. Yet Hezekiah understood the law of God and wanted to do something about it; to bring the people back to God. 

This tells us that when we are trying to lead our family or brothers and sisters back to God, it may seem like an insurmountable task. But we must not lose faith, because the testimony of Hezekiah and his faith team shows that since God worked with them, God will work with us too. 

Hezekiah spelled out the spiritual situation of God’s people to the Levites (v3-11). Sometimes when we want to turn our family members back to God, we need to speak out that something’s not quite right, so that everyone can come to the same judgement. Not just the father, mother, child. For EVERYONE to have the same judgement; something must change. 

Today we know that the True Jesus Church is the restored apostolic church. 
John 17:20-24 (read)
Jesus prayed not just for Peter’s generation but for ours as well. Jesus prayed for the True Jesus Church to restored just like the apostolic church. Why would this happen? 

v22 This means Jesus already received the truth and gave the truth to us. He’s given the prophecy He’s going to do to us. Therefore, everything will happen. 

Since this is the understanding we receive from God; the Holy Spirit is given to us which means we are to do the work; God’s love in our hearts means we should want to save souls; when the church becomes weak we should feel something in our hearts because we are part of the body of Christ. When something is not happening according to the prophecies of God, we know something’s not right. When our family isn’t strong, we know something’s not right. But when something’s not right, that doesn’t mean God has forsaken us. When we become aware of it, it’s like a prophet having his eyes opened by God. Why can the prophet see what’s wrong? Because God wants His people to be restored. So do not be discouraged when we realise where we should be and have not reached it. Because when we see it, this means God allows us the opportunity to progress in His work. Just like God showed Hezekiah, who showed the Levites. That’s how God puts together the faith team. 

2 Chron 29:12-19
Hezekiah commanded the Levites, the Levites gathered the other people together. 
v15 They fathered their brethren, sanctified themselves and went according to the commandments of the king, at the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord. 

2 Chron 29:25 repeats that the Levites acted according to the commandment of David and also the commandment of the Lord by His prophets. If we look at these two verses, it seems as if the Levites listened to the words of the king, but actually they listened to the word of God, because the king spoke the words of God. 

How do we build up a strong faith team then? We need to have people who believe in the word of God and speak the word of God. We need family members willing to believe God’s will and speak God’s will. 

2 Cor 4:13 (read)
Paul tells us the way to go here. Today if we want to encourage our family, work groups, youth groups, we need to practise holy communication. Today we may be able to come together and ask how our lives are, how business is, but how much of the time do we spend opening our hearts to speak about our faith to our brothers and sisters we’ve grown up with?

In the UK, there is the problem where the brothers like to talk about football. Many don’t talk about faith. Thank God, people began to change. At the beginning, it was awkward. Talking about faith seemed like a sensitive subject. But think about it: in the world, who will care about our faith and spiritual life? If we don’t talk about it at home and in church, do you really care about your spiritual life? Do you care about the spiritual lives of your brothers and sisters? But the beautiful thing is that when we seek to change that; sharing honestly with each other; sharing our struggles, fears, hopes; when we share at least we can pray for one another right? And we thank God that there’re cases where when people opened up and shared, they prayed for one another. After a while, they report back what God has done for them. Why? Because they know god has been working on their lives. When our faith has experienced more and more of God, then we can direct people in the right way. God is our helper. God is here. Today if we want to upgrade our faith, we need to speak words of faith. Since we believe, we say it. God will do the rest. 

Hezekiah knew God’s will and spike to let the Levites know what to do. The Levites followed through and did the will of God. 

2 Chron 29
v20-24 talks about why Hezekiah moved this faith team in the right direction. They sacrificed. v24 talks about the priest killing the sacrifices and making offerings for all of Israel. Hezekiah knew God’s people needed atonement. That’s why it was necessary for them to move in the spiritual direction according to God’s word. 

1 John 1:5-10
We need to have spiritual fellowship with one another, and especially with God. 
These verses tell us we need atonement as well. Why is it we can’t afford for any of our brothers and sisters to be distanced from Jesus and His church? Because we need the blood of Jesus. That’s why this faith team is important. It’s when we remind each other about God’s will and do God’s will does the blood of Jesus continue to cleanse us from all sins. That is why the efforts of RE teachers, youth leaders, coordination leaders are important. Because everyone needs the blood of Jesus. That’s why it’s important not just to set up a family altar, it’s not just so we can come together and do the action of praying and reading the Bible. It is so that our hearts are in God. We continue to reflect on God’s word and still see the need for Jesus to be the centre of our lives. That’s why every family and church needs a faith team that moves in the direction of God’s will. 

2 Chron 29:25-30
Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord. Not only this, he made sure the worship was proper and according to God’s word. 

So what does this teach us?
We have been given a position in the body of Christ. Usually we think about leadership when we think about position. But that’s a bit too narrow. The teaching of how God positions us in the body of Christ should apply to everyone of us. God has positioned you as someone older, more experienced, someone who has a greater measure of faith. You have experienced God more, your prayers have been answered more. Why is is that you are still in church? Why has God founded and rooted you in this position? For you to do God’s will and fulfil His salvation plan? Why does God allow you to be married and have children? Why does God allow you to be the older sibling? There’s a reason God gave you your position.  

Some people shy away from the position they’ve been given. They say it’s too much for them and that they didn’t ask for this. But that’s rather negative. We should view our position as an opportunity from God; to trust God and for Him to work through us. 

Why did the Levites in Hezekiah’s time work well? Because the Levites who were stationed didn’t leave their position. They were standing up and firm in their position for the sake of God’s people. 

Jude 6
We thank God that today we know the truth that the devil is the fallen angel. We must learn from the big mistake of the fallen angel. We have been baptised and joined to the body of Christ. We no longer just think about ourselves and live for this life only. This life can become a dead life if we just focus on ourselves. It’s not a life spiritual wise. But if we count our blessings that we have been planted and joined to the body of Christ, and are willing to take up our position and not move away from it, then we can join the team to serve God. 

The speaker isn’t sure if Singapore faces this problem. In the UK, after the youths get married and have children, they move away from the church. But thank God, they are visited by the ministers and ask them, “How are you going to save your children? Are you experiencing God? You have the Holy Spirit but is God with your family? If you care of God’s family, God will take care of your family too. When you experience God while serving in God’s family, you have a testimony to pass on to your children. If not it’ll just be empty talk; it’ll just be theory.” Thank God some listened and true. They reckoned it’s worth the sacrifice. 

In a particular church, a father and mother stayed behind to sleep with the youths. The speaker was very touched by their care for the youths and the church. To bring the children to serve God together is a very good way.

We see how Hezekiah and his team worked together. All of them knew their position. 

2 Chron 29:31-36
Truly Hezekiah oversaw setting the servants of God in order. 
v35 “The service of the house of the Lord was set in order”
We find that when we look at the tabernacle in Moses’ time, everything had to be put in order, THEN the glory of God filled it. In Solomon’s time, when everything was done according to God’s instruction, the glory of God was manifested. Today if we desire the glory of God to fill His church, we also need to make sure everything is in spiritual order. 

Activities are important in the church. Activities are a tool we encourage and edify one another. But the activity must be based on the truth to lead people closer to the will of God. So when we look at the church, we shouldn’t base it on feelings, the number of members, or the number of activities. We need to compare our church to the word of God. Are we still in line with the direction of the church being glorifying to God?

For example, past generations were very willing to serve God. The present generation is also willing to serve God. But how about the next generation? When you move to the next stage of life, are you still going to be as committed to the people who built up this church? When every generation is as willing, then we can see spiritual order and place. So don’t think the church pressurises you to do God’s work. No. The church is inviting you to be part of God’s will so you can also be part of God’s glory. So you have faith experience and pass your faith to others around you too. 

Be willing, just like the people in the time of Hezekiah in 2 Chron 29:31b “the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings”.
Did you know a heart of willingness is a sign of us joining in the spiritual order of God’s church? That’s the way to experience God’s work. 

How do we know it’s true?
2 Chron 20:36 (read)
When you put v31 and v36 together, we see the people were willing. Everyone moved in God’s direction. Everyone was doing God’s will. Then people rejoiced. People changed. People were doing God’s will. And it took a short time. Because God’s people were willing. 

If we want to be positioned permanently and gloriously in God’s salvation plan, let us take the leadership in our family. Lead not just by example. Tell our family with a God fearing heart why we are going to make these changes. Because we have to improve ourselves to help the church of God grow. Because God’s plan is like that. All of us have this responsibility. All of us need to be committed. 

May God bless the church in Singapore. May spiritual blessings be bestowed upon the church. 

368: O Zion, Haste
Verse 4 of this hymn is a very moving and instructive message:
Give of thy sins to bear the message glorious;
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
And all thou spendest Jesus will repay 

God has brought us to where we are. There’s only so much one life can do. But if God has blessed you, and your children, why not send them on? Why not encourage them for a better life that has eternal returns? Why not send them on to a higher meaning in life? Send them out to serve. To study for God.
