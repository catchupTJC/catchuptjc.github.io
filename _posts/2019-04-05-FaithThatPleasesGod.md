We know our home is not this world and that we are sojourners here. We know that our home is in the Kingdom of Heaven. All of us hope that one day we can return to this heavenly hope of ours to be with our Heavenly Father forever. But the Bible tells us without faith, it’s impossible to please God. It’s also impossible to see God. 

The question we want to ask ourselves today is: do we have a faith that pleases God? Today we shall learn from the example of Abraham, the father of faith, to know the content of what faith pleases God. 

1. A faith that pleases God is a faith that obeys the word of God 
Gen 12:1-6
God called Abram out of his country Haran, out of his family, out of his father’s house to a land God would show him. God asked Abram to get out of his comfort zone; a place he was familiar with to a land God would show him. But if we read the verses carefully, God didn’t tell him where the land would be. God only said He would make his name great, make him a blessing, bless those who bless him and curse those who curse him. Many promises are stated. But none of them were tangible. Abram couldn’t feel or touch these blessings. They seem so far away from him. If we are Abraham and God tells us to get out of our comfort zone and go on a journey which has a length we know not of, to receive blessings we aren’t sure we will get. What would we do?

Abraham obeyed. He plucked his family out of their comfort zone to journey into an uncertain future. He had taken a great risk. 

If we are Abraham, what would you do? Some of us may say: God are you joking with me? At least tell me where I’m headed. At least give me a sign. 

We see Abraham, the father of truth, obeyed and departed without asking for any signs. 

Heb 11:8
Why was Abraham so willing to obey the word of God? It was an uncertain future. We read v6. 

Here we read that Abraham believed:
(1) that God is 
(2) that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him

Because he believed this, he believed what God said will surely come to past. That’s why he obeyed without question. 

Many of us have been Christians since young. Have we truly believed the words of God? Do we base our decisions on His word? When we decide on the work and course of studies, the friends we want to mix with, the way that we dress, the entertainment we watch, do we factor God in? Have we considered whether the things we are doing pleases God or not? Do we hold fast to His word not to sin against Him? Or do we tell ourselves, “Never mind. God is love, He won’t mind. He’ll surely forgive me even if I do bad things.” This is the concept of many of us and Christians in other churches today. They reckon since God is love, He will forgive no matter what they do. As long as they go back to church and pray for repentance, God will forgive them. But is this the right concept?

1 Sam 15:22-23
God esteems that we obey His words. He wants us to be submissive to His word. He prefers for us to obey His word than for us to sacrifice. In fact, if we don’t obey the words of God, v23 says it’s like rebellion or a sin of witchcraft. It’s like stubbornness, iniquity and idolatry. Because we don’t have God in our hearts in the first place. We’re unwilling to submit to Him, which is a great sin. 

Let us learn to obey the words of God. Let us learn to take heed of every word of God. Let us learn from the example of Abraham to believe in every word of God. 

2. A faith that pleases God is a faith that believes in the promises of God
Rom 4:17-22
When Abraham was 99, God appeared to him and promised his wife Sarah who was 89 would have a son. Abraham laughed because looking from a physical aspect, it’s impossible for he and his wife to have a son at such an old age. 

Gen 17:19-21
When God reaffirmed Sarah would indeed bear a son (Isaac) and said He would establish His covenant with Isaac, Abraham believed. Therefore what was mentioned in Rom 4:17-18 shows it wasn’t easy for Abraham to believe in being able to have a son. But Rom 4:19-20 shows that Abraham didn’t waver in the promise. Why did he have a belief that surpasses what Man seems impossible? The key is in Gen 17. Initially Abraham laughed. But when God said He would establish His covenant with Isaac, Abraham immediately believed. He didn’t just believe, he believed with his whole heart. What is this covenant and why did it cause Abraham to believe? This covenant was the one mentioned when God called Abraham out of Haran, and the promises were intangible. So what caused Abraham to believe when the covenant for mentioned?

When Abraham left Haran, he experienced the guidance, blessings and protection of God. He experienced God being the active party in the covenant. When Abraham went down to Egypt, he almost lost Sarah to Pharaoh. But God protected, enabling both Abraham and Sarah to return to Canaan. When Lot was taken captive by 4 kings who were strong in military might (they had defeated 5 kings). Abraham only had 318 trained servants who were just shepherds, not full time soldiers. They wouldn’t have much experience in fighting war. But they were able to defeat the 4 kings and save Lot. Abraham was able to experience God in his daily life. These experiences affirmed the promise and covenant God had made with him. 

Therefore when God spoke this covenant, Abraham immediately believed; that Sarah would bear him a son. 

Today God also promises us 2 things. 
1) Holy Spirit
John 14:16-18
Jesus promised us the Holy Spirit. He wants to stay in each and everyone of us. He doesn’t want to leave us as orphans without hope and help. He wants to guide us in our walk of faith. Do we believe in this promise of Jesus? Many of us have received the Holy Spirit. But there are some of have prayed for many years and still have not received. Have we lost faith in this promise? Do we still pray hard for this promise?

2) Heaven
John 14:1-4
Jesus promised us He will go and prepare a place for us, and that He would come again. This refers to heaven and the second coming of Jesus. Those who are unbelieving will be thrown into the everlasting fire.

Many brothers and sisters have started swaying in their faith. They no longer focus on their faith to prepare for the second coming of Jesus. They’re busy in the world seeking more money, and a more luxurious life. They stopped believing that Jesus is the most important portion in their lives. 

How about us? Do we continue to hold fast to this faith? If we have an intimate relationship with our God, just like Abraham, we will surely experience God in our lives. We will surely hold fast to these two precious promises. And these two promises will surely come to pass. 

3. A faith that pleases God will result in actions according to the word of God
Gen 22:1-3
God tested Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac as a burnt offering. At that time, Abraham truly understood what a burnt offering was. That meant killing, cutting open, letting out the blood, and putting the body on the altar for sacrifice. The body at the end will become ashes. 

If you were Abraham, what would you do? Willie you panic? Would you ask God, “Why are You so cruel?”

What did Abraham do? 
“So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son...”
Abraham was obedient towards God. There was no hint he tried to delay the process. He seems to be eager to follow the command of God. He woke up EARLY in the morning and set out to do the commands of God. He did this without delay. He didn’t ask God for a few more days. Why was he so willing to offer his son up? Was it because he was an extremist? Or was it because he was mad?

The reason is in v5.
Abraham told his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and WE will come back to you.“ Abraham truly believed Isaac would come back with him. Why?

Heb 11:17-19
Abraham truly believed God would establish His eternal covenant with Isaac. God would surely multiply his descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. He believed that even if Isaac turned to ash, God will surely allow Isaac to live again; that Isaac would surely return with him to the young men. Abraham’s faith was truly built on the promises of God. And what is truly precious is that he grabbed hold of every word of God, and coupled his faith with actions. 

Therefore he brought Issac to be sacrificed. Do we similarly have this faith coupled with actions?

Jas 2:20-24
Faith without works is dead. Elder James further explained that Abraham’s faith was made perfect because it was accompanied with works. This was when he attempted to sacrifice Isaac his son. 

To have a faith that pleases God, our faith must thus be coupled with works. 

Matt 6:19-20
Our actions must correspond with our faith. If we lay up treasures on earth, our hearts will naturally be fixed on this earth. But if we lay up treasures on heaven, our hearts will naturally yearn for heaven. In our walk of faith, do we focus on God or this world? Do we have God as our priority? If we want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, we must focus our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. 

When we lay our treasure in heaven, we will spend time to read the Bible, pray and attend church services. We will lead our lives according for the word of God. We will serve God with all our heart, soul and mind. When we do this, we will have a faith that’s coupled with actions. Our life direction and the things we do will be aligned. Only such a faith can please God. 

Do we have a faith that pleases God? A faith that is obedient to the word of God. A faith that believes in the promises of god. A faith that is coupled with actions. May God add on to our faith.
