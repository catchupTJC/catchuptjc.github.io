What is the most important factor in marriage?  
We have to have direction.  
What does direction mean in this case?  
Direction means that we have to have purpose and we should know who our guide is when there is trouble within.  
Genesis 2:18 is where God tells us about the purpose of marriage.  
Marriage is to have a companion in life, to have a helper and to get our feed in life.  
If we are not going in the same direction in life, how can we have a happy marriage?  
God made Adam a helper so that Adam had a companion in faith.  
If Adam was struggling in faith, Eve was there to bring him up.  
Matthew 19:6  
Union of same faith so that they become one.  
2 Corinthians 6:14-15  
Who is your guide and counselor when trouble comes?  
Ephesians 5:21-25  
We should turn to God for guidance when there is conflict.  
Death of a spouse is the most stressful event.  
Marriage life is a journey where there are experiences.  
If there are happy moments but there are also losses on the way then what is it all about?  
How can we look forward to it? If it is not even geared to heaven, then how can we be truly happy at the end?  
A happy marriage is where we know that the couple will reach heaven together.
