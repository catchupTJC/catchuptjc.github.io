When Jesus walked on the earth, He selected a small group of people. This doesn’t just refer to the 12 apostles, it refers to other disciples too. Nonetheless, they were still a small group of people. 

Luke 12:32 
v22 says what Jesus said was addressing His disciples. He said to them, “Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”
His disciples were indeed a little flock. Even the whole of Israel compared to the whole world is small. Now within Israel is a small group of people, not just in terms of numbers but also ability and strength. Most uneducated. Many of them were women. They followed Jesus as He preached the Kingdom of Heaven. One day He said to them, “Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”
How can a small group of people not trained to fight, not politicians and leaders, receive the kingdom?

Jesus said not to fear. On their own, they don’t have the ability to rule even if God gives them the kingdom. Cast out your fear. Receive the kingdom and know the kingdom will be yours forever. 

What was their fear? If we look at what Jesus said later, we realise these people didn’t have fears like “can I really receive the kingdom?” 

Their worries are reflected in 12:22-29. Clothes, food, etc. 

Before the entire Israel was taken captive into foreign lands, they were a powerful kingdom. During the times of David and Solomon, the surrounding kingdoms had to give them tribute. That’s why Solomon had so much gold. Despite that, Solomon in all his glory was not strayed like the lilies. 

Solomon’s kingdom is not comparable to the kingdom to come. Even the lilies of this kingdom are more glorious than Solomon’s glories. One can only imagine how much the better the kingdom that’s coming is. 

Ultimately God is going to give us the kingdom. Why are you worried about what to eat? This also reflects the psychology at that time. They were under foreign rule. They weren’t just oppressed by foreign people, also their own - tax collectors who worked for the Romans, their religious leaders. There were many people like blind man Bartimaeus and the woman who offered two mites. Then Jesus came. 

He said to the people who were of little in number and strength who worried about little things and clothing. He tells them not to fear, for God would give them the kingdom.

v30 (read) shows that God wants His disciples to transcend all these things. Life is more than food. “These are the things the nations worry about. You don’t need to.” This is saying their life is of much more worth than the life of the people in other nations. Because it pleases the Father to give us the kingdom. So our lives is precious in the eyes of God. If other people die, they won’t receive the kingdom. Let them die. But we won’t die. We’ll be kept alive by the Father’s love. We must live on because we’re going to receive the kingdom, which is everlasting. 

Life is more than food. Our lives are more important than food. Our bodies are more important than clothes. Our bodies are no different from non-believers. But after death, we’ll be clothed with immortality. “Mortality will be swallowed up by life/immortality.” This was the original piece of clothing Adam and Eve wore. After sinning, they were stripped of the garment of immortality. Their eyes were opened and realised they were naked. They no longer had immortality. 

Don’t be worried about what you have to eat or wear because you have eternal life. The food you’ll be given in His kingdom is real food. The clothing you’ll be given in His kingdom is eternal life. 

Why do you live your life like the other nations? They don’t know God. They don’t have God as king. 

v31 “Seek the Kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you.”
Do you believe in this? That if we first seek the Kingdom of God, God will give us all we need. 

Or do we respond like a Chinese saying: I don’t even know about this life. How can I imagine eternal life?

Let me fill myself in this life first then I can consider eternal life. 

Many people listened. If they don’t listen and continue to seek what to eat and wear, there would be no Christianity today. 

So many people have heard of Jesus Christ. The Bible has been translated into so many languages. Despite persecution, the Christian faith still exists. Isn’t it proof enough that the words of Jesus Christ is true? Because His followers sought the Kingdom of God first. Christianity didn’t just survive but GREW.  The religious leaders sought the benefits of the world. They wouldn’t have been able to bring the word of God to the world. Who did? This small group of people that the Lord called ‘little flock’. That were called ‘a bunch of unlearned men’ by other people. Their survival is a miracle and a testament that seeking the Kingdom of God first results in all things being added unto us. 

Yet many of us can’t trust this. The speaker hopes we can realise that the survival of the Christian Faith is undeniable proof of v31 seek the Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you.

Luke 6:20-23
When Jesus says to seek the Kingdom of God first and all these things shall be added unto you, Jesus isn’t closing His eyes to the reality of poverty. He’s not denying the fact they were poor or had difficulties finding their daily food. He acknowledges His disciples were underprivileged people. v20 shows He’s specially talking to His disciples, not everyone. “Blessed are YOU poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.” He acknowledges their hunger. “Blessed are YOU who hunger now, for you shall be filled.” He acknowledges the fact that they’re oppressed. “Blessed are YOU who weep now...when men hate you” He acknowledges this. And He knows if they were to follow Him, things will get worse. “For the Son of Man’s sake” Jesus was honest. He didn’t just say the good side. While He acknowledges the dire state they were in, He tells them that their faith will help them tide over their difficulties. Our Heavenly Father knows we need this reassurance(?). 

Later Jesus turned to those who weren’t His disciples and said woe to them who are rich, full, etc. 

Jesus’ disciples were the underprivileged ones. But because they chose to walked the difficult path. It’s easier for us if we don’t have any morals. We can walk many ways but we’re restricted by our morals. Physically, our path is difficult. 

But when we trust that our Father will give us the kingdom, we rather be part of the lesser group that chooses to tread the difficult path. 

Luke 13:22
Walk the narrow way, go to the narrow gate. The people at that time were bombarded by many different teachers. Even those who followed Jesus will one day go back to their former teachers for they find Jesus’ teachings too difficult. 
Go into the narrow gate. Many will give up and go back to the broad way. Jesus will say He doesn’t know us. 

The people who ate the 5 loaves and 2 fish followed m Him across the sea of Galilee. But many only came for the food. Jesus then said several hard sayings to distinguish the truth disciples from those who weren’t. After these hard sayings, many left Him. Jesus will say He doesn’t know them. 

What are the choices we have been making? When it comes to spiritual meeting, what are the choices that we meals. When it comes to serving God, living our enemies. Many choices. Look at ours. Look at our lives. Perhaps some of us have a household in difficulty. Look to God. Do we persist even when it’s difficult?

Look at ourselves. Are we will worrying about food and clothes? 

Are we fighting battles in church or our own personal problems? Marital problems? Children problems? Work problems? Personal weaknesses? Psychological problems many of these things are self inflicted. So much so that we don’t have time for the Kingdom of Heaven. 

Luke 8:9-10
Again Jesus is addressing His disciples. Many people were just curious onlookers or enemies looking to see where He stumbled. But a small group were His disciples. They asked Him to explain the parable of the sower. 

Why did Jesus want to give them the kingdom? Because they bothered to ask for a deeper explanation. Why are they given the kingdom? Not because they’re smarter. They too didn’t understand the parable. The difference is that they came to ask. Most didn’t understand but they didn’t bother to ask. The disciples were able to understand because they bothered to ask.

What category of people do we belong to? Those who bother to ask? Those who bother to find out the meaning when they read the Bible and don’t understand. Or those who don’t bother to find out when we don’t understand. Which are we? Be those who find out when we don’t understand. Like the little flock who sought to find out and will inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. 

John 10:16
This little flock will have people joining them. This little flock began because the shepherd gave His life/body and blood for them. Today we have joined the little flock. It has grown because we have joined them and received the gospel. 

This little flock is known as the church. 
Acts 20:28
As we remember the death of Jesus Christ, as we partake the Holy Communion, let us remember. Because Jesus gave us His blood and body. We have been purchased by His blood. We have been privileged to be in His flock. We now know the mysteries of the kingdom. Continue on this difficult path and teach the nations.  

Matt 28:19
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. 

It’s this little flock, the church of God, that will conquer all nations.
