In this world, not only Christians but also non-Christians receive God’s grace. The world is subject to decay but it’s God’s will for all men to be saved. That’s why He extends His grace to all men through Jesus Christ. 

Mark 6:34
When Jesus came into the world, He saw that the multitude were like sheep without a shepherd, so He began to teach them many things. This is because Jesus has a heart of compassion willing to share God’s grace. However, not all received this grace. 

This sermon will examine people who did receive God’s grace. We will better understand why God gives grace, why some receive grace and why some don’t after praying. 

Luke 7:1-10
A centurion pled for Jesus to heal his servant. His plea was answered. WHY was his prayer answered?

The centurion only came to know about Jesus by hearsay (风闻). There were many Jews who personally witnessed Jesus’ miracles and still didn’t believe. But this centurion believed even though he had not seen! 

A similar incident:
A syro-Phoenician woman pled for her daughter to be healed. Again, she had only come to know about Jesus by hearsay, and yet believed. This is again in contrast with many Jews who had witnessed what Jesus did and yet didn’t believe.

These two people’s faith were specially praised by Jesus. 

For us to reflect: why don’t we have strong faith even after believing in God for so long?

Luke 7:3
Take note that the centurion sent ELDERS of the Jews to Jesus. This shows how much he cared for his servants. 

During the reign of the Romans, centurions are known to be tyrants; cruel and merciless. Think how the Roman soldiers treated Jesus on the cross. But this centurion was different; he loved his own servant. 

Why didn’t he go on his own to see Jesus Christ? Why did he send someone else instead?

Luke 3:7
“I did not even think myself worthy to come to You.”
For a Roman official with power and authority to say this reflects how unique this centurion was. Furthermore, he had soldiers under him (Roman officials with military control had more power). 

Moreover, Jews are proud and don’t want to have anything to do with other races. But for this centurion, they disregarded race. This shows the centurion was pleasing to both God and men. They begged Jesus earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, “for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue”. 

This centurion loved his nation and even the Jews. He was so loved that even the proud Jewish elders were willing to plead his case. 

Back to the question of why the centurion did not want to meet Jesus initially. In actuality, he did meet Jesus.

Matt 8:5
Matthew records the centurion came to Jesus. v6 explains what sickness the servant had: paralysed, dreadfully tormented. 

So why?
1. He didn’t think himself worthy is the most straightforward answer.
2. Another reason could be that: he reckoned himself to be a gentile, not one of the chosen people of Israel. For Jesus to come to his place wouldn’t be according to custom. This reflects the centurion was humble and considerate to consider others’ perspectives. 

John 4:9
When Jesus asked the Samaritan woman for a drink, she answered in this way, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” This shows how Jews had no dealings with other races, which bolsters reason 2. 

Acts 10:28
Even after the downpour of the Holy Spirit, this ostracising if Gentiles continued. Even Peter, who had seen visions about how the Gentiles should be affected, continued in this. The cultural perception of Gentiles was very strong. 

Back to reason 2. Perhaps the centurion thought himself unworthy for Jesus to come to his house, so he walked out to meet Jesus first. A humble and understanding centurion. 

Our God is a God who understands people. He saw the faith of the centurion. 

Luke 7:7-8
“But say the word, and my servant will be healed.”
“For I also am a man...having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes...”

He believed the words of Jesus Christ have power. He believed Jesus was a God with authority. Jesus MARVELLED at his faith. “I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel.”

This was why the centurion’s plea was answered.

Do we see what the centurion saw? Do we have faith like his? Believing that what Jesus said will come to pass. 

If we have simple faith and a humble attitude like the centurion, Jesus will acknowledge our plea. 

When we come before Jesus, it can’t be said we don’t have faith, since we actually come before Him. However, there’s more to faith than just coming before Jesus Christ. Can we be as humble as the centurion?

Luke 18:9-14
A Pharisee and tax collector came to the temple to pray. Coming to the temple to pray to God shows that they have faith. However, the Pharisee’s prayer was not accepted. His prayer was like talking to himself. He wasn’t praying for God’s mercy. He didn’t humble himself. Rather, he bragged about himself and trampled upon other people. 

Now the tax collector dared not even raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast asking God for mercy. 

We shouldn’t be like the Pharisee comparing ourselves to other people. Remember that God can compare us to other people as well. 

v14 “Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbled himself will be exalted.”

Even though the Pharisee’s prayer was longer, that doesn’t mean God is more likely to listen. Recall that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. 

The centurion pled not for himself but for his servant.
Luke 11:5-6
A man had a friend who visited him at midnight. However, he had no food to set before him. The main takeaway from this story is to be persistent. But another thing to note is that the reason why the man was so persistent wasn’t for himself but for his friend. 

There was a sister who grew up in church. Most children in church have been taught by their parents to go to the front to pray for the Holy Spirit. After 20 years, she still hadn’t received the Holy Spirit. 

The speaker’s theological classmate shared this testimony that happened at a church he pastored:
One day, she invited her friend for an evangelistic service. She noticed her friend wasn’t that interested in the sermon. Next came the prayer for the Holy Spirit. She asked her friend to go in front with her, the friend agreed albeit reluctantly. She prayed, “God please give my friend the Holy Spirit. I’m worried she won’t come to church anymore.” In that prayer, SHE received the Holy Spirit when she prayed for someone else. 

Just like the centurion who pled for his servant. This sister pled for her friend because she wanted her to receive the grace she had received. 

Another testimony:
At gold coast Australia, the speaker was giving an evangelistic sermon. It was then the prayer. Amongst the truthseekers who came forward to pray was a mother carrying her baby. She had many reasons not to join the prayer. But she was humble and earnest. 

There’re many reasons why people receive the Holy Spirit. But most importantly, it is because of God’s grace. 

You witness people around you receiving the Holy Spirit. Do you believe the Holy Spirit will be yours too?

Do we also spiritually nurture ourselves to love other people?

Let us meditate on these questions in prayer.
