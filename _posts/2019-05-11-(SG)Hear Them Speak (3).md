The previous sermon discussed 6 objects.

7) Balloon  
The balloon said, “As long as someone blows into me, I’ll float in the wind. But if I’m blown too strongly, I may burst!”

Human beings are just like balloons. When we’re praised by others, we feel very happy like we’re floating. That’s why we like to be with people who praise us. We derive happiness from their praise. Yet the Bible reminds us that the praises of Man test us. 

Prov 27:21  
The refining pot and the furnace are able to remove the initiatives in silver and gold. Likewise the praise of men can reveal the thoughts and intents of a person’s heart. It’s especially able to bring out the true feelings within a person’s heart. That’s why whenever we’re praised by someone, what kind of heart do we have? If we feel delighted and attribute it to ourselves, thinking we’re great when we’re praised, that’s a heart of pride. But if we attribute the glory to God and that we aren’t worth much actually; we thank the Lord for giving us the capability to do this job well and that we have to keep putting in effort to bring glory to God when praised, this is a heart of humility. 

When others are praised by another, how do we feel in our hearts? If we feel angry or unhappy when someone is praised by another, this is a heart of jealousy. But if we think: yes indeed he deserves praise! This is a magnanimous heart. 

Therefore how we react to praise directed to us and praise directed to others reflects what kind 

Since such praise tests men, should we praise others then? Some people feel we shouldn’t praise others, because it may cause us to stumble. But criticism causes people to stumble too, why do we still do it then?

Jesus Christ praised a number of people in the Bible. If praises cause people to stumble, isn’t Jesus causing people to fall? While Jesus praised many people in the gospel books, He rebuked many too. This shows us that Jesus praises and rebukes those who are deserving of praise or rebuke. 

Rev 2:2-4  
Did Jesus praise or rebuke the church of Ephesus? He praised their good works. “I know your works, your labour and patience. That you cannot bear those who are evil. You have tested those who have said they’re apostles....youvhahe perdervedef and laboured for My name’s sake and not become weary.”

These are indeed worthy of praise from Jesus. But they also have their flaws. Even if it’s just a single flaw, (we may think they’re already 90% perfect why make a ruckus) Jesus saw it necessary to point it out. From this we learn if someone ought to be praised, praise. If someone needs to be rebuked, we pluck up the courage to rebuke. One thing from us to learn is that Jesus praised before we rebuked. 

Often we see the virtues of a person. But we tend to focus on their errors and talk about that. Why are we like this? Nice Chinese phrase. Because we feel it’s important for people to learn, if they learn, we feel better. So we’re often focused on correcting another. We want them to be better. A kitchen knife becomes sharper the more it’s sharpened. If you don’t rebuke that person, he’ll never know he’s in the wrong and never change. This becomes another reason for us to criticise/rebuke a person. 

We feel good medicine is bitter. That’s why we always give bitter medicine, because we think it’s good. But is it always the case good medicine is bitter? There’s medicine that’s good that’s not bitter too, easier for people to accept. 


Your good medicine can become medicine of no use. If we’re too stern in our rebuke, we may not get the outcome we hope to achieve. 

That’s doesn’t mean we shouldn’t rebuke at all. But we need to consider whether we’re too harsh to the extent the person cannot accept it. If our rebuke us able to correct their mistake but hurt their self esteem in the process, it may not be good after all. When a person’s self esteem is hurt, he/she may close him/herself to you. He may not treat you as a friend anymore but an enemy who hurts you. 

If you praise, you can draw closer to him. Then you can understand the person’s POV. When you propose a reasonable suggestion, it becomes easier for the person to accept. That’s why we see the Lord Jesus first bringing up the Ephesus’ church good works. He understands all the Labour’s we have gone through. 

“Yet there’s still one thing I have to rebuke you for”  
At this time they won’t resist him but listen carefully “huh what is it”

But we need to use our praises wisely and not misuse it. Using our praises wisely benefit 

It’s good to be sincere and praise appropriately. The other party will feel a sense of self worth. It’ll motive them to change to do even better. A discouraged person can become more encouraged with praise. A person who has encoutered a big failure can receive encouragement in his heart. 

But excessive praises can cause more harm. Because behind such excessive praises can be a hidden agenda that’s not good. If the other party isn’t able to discern the hidden motive, he may fall. 

We tend to rebuke others too much. So we need to praise more. Some people comment the speaker’s sermons tend to rebuke people a lot. Some people may have felt offended. “Are my words of rebuke too strength? Is it that I don’t consider your self esteem? This is another topic.”

Praise those who should be praised.  
Sincere and appropriate rebuke is good. 

Praise those deserving of praise and rebuke those worthy of rebuke. 

The balloon also says that if we blow too strongly, it’ll burst! So when we praise others, we have to do it appropriately. Those who have praised also need to learn how to withstand. Lest we get lost in praise. 

A scholar was invited to an event. The event was to commend him for his work. It was also an opportunity for people who admired him to gather to get to know him. But he rejected it. Why? He said, “If you eat an egg and it’s delicious, do you want to find out about the chicken who laid it?” 

This is an interesting scholar. If we learn from his humour and wisdom, we may have less trouble in life. 

8. Peanut  
The peanut said, “My face is all wrinkly, it seems like I’m at the end of my life. But within me, I have a heart that’s still red and alive.”

A peanut shell has many creases. But when you open it, reddish skin protects its insides.

The words of this peanut reminds us about the words Caleb said. 

Joshua 14:10-12 (read)  
When the Israelites were about to enter Canaan to conquer it, one of the strongest tribes was the Anakim. Joshua was deciding who to send to conquer them. This was difficult. Because they were close coworkers, from young to old age, they continued to be good coworkers. 

Good coworkers not only help but are also able to understand one another. We first need to understand the situation to help. Some people have good intention to help but because they don’t understand the full picture, they may cause more harm than help. We can’t really blame them because they do so with a good intention. But if the other party really understood the situation, we would be thankful for their help. 

When Moses brought the Israelites to Canaan, they sent spies in. Even before fighting them, they didn’t want to go in. “They’re giants! We’re grasshoppers! We don’t want to go in!” Only Joshua and Caleb said God would surely help them and they’d be victorious. They had faith. 

Now they’re in their latter years. Yet we see Caleb still had the same amount of faith and courage. “I am this day 85 years old. Yet I am as strong this day as that day Moses sent me.” What aged Caleb said caused the youths there to break out in cold sweat. All of them could fight. But they close to face easy battles, unwilling to fight strong enemies. Yet seeing 85 year old Caleb who was proactive and wanted to fight the tough enemy, a number of young men were inspired to pluck up their courage to fight the enemy. They would give the easier work to those who were weaker. As for the more challenging tasks, the stronger take up. 

Possible application: those who are wealthier should take up work the wealthy can do. And those who are poorer take up work the poor can do better. Complement each other and take up the work you can do better. 

Some of us are so strong we can beat up a lion. But some people are so brittle wind causes them to fall. Those who are strong should bear the scruples of those who are weak. What’s most important is to understand what gifts/capabilities God has given us. Caleb knew this clearly while he was young and still understood this when old. Perhaps he knew he couldn’t fight this war but knew his words could make a difference. When these people lost faith in fighting this war, they were reminded and encouraged. 

Caleb has left a good example for us. One day we will become old. Our physical strength, mental capabilities, eyesight won’t be like in the past. 

This morning when the speaker left the house, he couldn’t remember what he forgot. Most importantly was to bring his sermon script. Good thing he remembered. One day we will become old. Then we’ll truly understand what it means to have the heart but not be able to do it. 

We cannot anticipate when we will lose our strength. This causes us to be afraid, doesn’t it? Some old people fall down suddenly. “I told you to be careful!” “I was careful!!!! I just suddenly lost strength.”

The speaker used to always scold his mother to be careful. 

Suddenly, your hands and legs lose strength. Some people who don’t understand may comment “are you bluffing?” These words can hurt the elderly’s feelings. Of course there’re some elderly who require more attention. They say they feel pain here here here but doctor says actually there’s nothing wrong, they just need company. 

Many parts of us age. But let not our heart age. Let it be renewed. Physically, all aspects of our body grow old but the Bible says our hearts can be renewed. 

2 Cor 4:16-18 (read)  
Getting old can really cause us to be fearful. We feel our strength and independence diminishing. Things no longer start to be in our control. If we can’t even control this, no wonder fear is in our hearts. We start to be afflicted with more illnesses. Yet, we have to face them. Paul says not to lose heart. Yes, the outward man will perish. But our inward man can be renewed! The Holy Spirit wants to renew our hearts. So that within our hearts we have new hope, hope of the heavenly kingdom. This becomes a source of strategy, comfort and courage to meet all these obstacles. Just like what Paul said. He met with many moments concerning life or death yet he didn’t worry. “It is good for me to leave and be with the Lord.” This comes about when the Holy Spirit renews our hearts. This hope beyond compare brings comfort to our hearts. So we don’t have fear towards death but hope. So we can continue walking on. (Perhaps this message is more suitable for an evergreen service LOL)

The peanut also said, “I am not like other fruit trees whose fruits are high above the ground that others can see. But I bear mine underground where others can’t see.”

While peanuts do flower on their branches, their fruit is underground. Christians should be like peanuts. We don’t need to bear fruits in the sky for others to see. Rather, we should do it silently for the Lord to see. This is what the Lord Jesus has taught us. 

Matt 6:1-2  
There’re people who want their fruits to be seen by everyone. If they’re asked to do something no one will appreciate or find out, they’re not interested. If they only value doing things where they can receive Man’s praise, they have already received their reward. They won’t receive reward from God. 

Let us do work for the Lord to see, not to parade it around. It’s okay if others don’t see it. It’s enough if the Lord sees it. The speaker thanks the Lord there’re a number of brothers and sisters who bear fruit like peanuts, silently. 

Let’s not be like the Pharisees who seem godly outwardly. This is a very big danger in our faith. Especially in the last days. Many Christians will have an outward appearance that seems godly. But in their hearts, there’s no sense of godliness.  

2 Tim 3 talks about the perils in the last days. Paul tells us to be vigilant and guard ourselves in these perils.  
v1 These perils mentioned weren’t wars or famines. Not that these aren’t perils. But they only harm our body not our soul. They’re not the true perils but temporary. True perils harm our soul that we lose our eternal life, ending up being eternally condemned. Therein lies the true perils. 

It’s good to read this list and see if any weaknesses corresponds with us. 

2 Tim 3:5 (read)  
Do only people living in the last days face this peril? No. People in the past too have outward godliness but aren’t. But there’re fewer in the past. Now, more and more people will appear godly but aren’t. More and more people live by their own principals and morals. Many people come actively in church and are orderly. But it’s a pity this is only done in the church. 

Some people say, “Preacher, don’t you know? How these people are like outside?”  
“I know. Even if I don’t see Paul already said so.”

We have to preserve ourselves so we don’t end up like such people. 

Some people say: you should ignore these kind of negative topics while speaking on the pulpit. Just like earlier we should praise more, rebuke less. Well, the speaker has praised, now it’s time to rebuke. 

We shouldn’t be like people on the  
More importantly, cultivate a godly heart. 

But we shouldn’t only focus on having a godly heart and not have an outward form of godliness. Another headache. Especially for youths. They come for service but when you see how they dress, you get a headache. You’re afraid if you speak of it they’ll get hurt and not want to come. 

Some parents say, “Don’t say so much later no one wants to come to church.” 

If you ask a person, “Why you wear like this?”  
They reply, “God looks at the inner person. Why’re you like other people concerned about how I dress, my hair, etc, why not focus on my heart willing to come for service?”

Speaker disclaims: If What he’s mentioned relates to you, it’s coincidental LOL

Indeed, God looks at the person’s heart but He also esteems the stature conduct and behaviour that comes out of s personMe heart. God knows and sees the godliness in your heart. But if your outward appearance doesn’t complement your inward heart, God also sees. 

If you go see your boss and wear shorts and slippers looking cool, would you do that? If you wear a suit to a picnic, that’s strange too. Doesn’t complement the occasion. 

So now we come to church and worship God. In church during spring cleaning for SM, members are encouraged to change into more comfortable clothes. Not a demand to wear nice clothes to clean. 

But while we worship God, we should dress properly. If we neglect whom we are worshipping, is there any value in our presence here? The prophets say “God is in the midst of the temple” but the people neglect this. When they offer sacrificed in the temple they neglect God is there.

Therefore We shouldn’t limit our godlinessbinpur hearts but alsobdisplay it in our conduct. 

God told Moses to take off his sandals for it was holy ground. Think about it it’s wilderness many thorns and thistles. But because God was there, it was holy ground. God saw the godliness in moses’ heart. That’s why He appeared to him. Bit at the same tome God demanded Moses to express his godliness but taking off his sandals. Moses understood this and removed them. Typically you wouldn’t remove them in the desert lest you hurt your feet. But now you’re coming before before. Take off your sandals. 

Out of a man’s heart comes out a person’s conduct. If what you have in your heart is good, what you express is truly good. But if what you do is evil, how can you say your heart is good?

Therefore if we have s godly heart, we should express it outwardly too. From head to toe, express this godliness towards God. Don’t be too concerned about what other people say about us. Be more concerned about God who is there watching us. 

There’s a children song that talks about the attitude we should come before God. 

LOL SPEAKER CLEARS HIS THROAT AND STARTS SINGING  
(Copy paste the song)  
当你来到会堂里  
我们安安静静走

We need to have a godly heart and be godly in our outwardness too. Be like the peanut. We don’t need to show everyone what we do. Bear our fruits silently, just for the Lord to see.
