David the man after the heart of God neglected to inquire of God, prophet Nathan also neglected to. David gathered the leaders to discuss, thought it was good, but didn't inquire so it turned out bad. They wanted to bring the ark to Jerusalem because he wanted to inquire, but in bringing it to Jerusalem he neglected to inquire. We learn that Man ought to place God first in their lives and inquire of God in everything.

David wasn't perfect but loved God. David was a special character in the Bible. Entire life had lots of ups and downs. If in a movie, it would be exciting. Even though Bible divides Samuel and chronicles and kings into two books, David is the character most often mentioned in Samuel, even though it's called Samuel. David is constantly mentioned. Same for chronicles - at least 62 chapters about David.

He was a shepherd and warrior and psalmist. Became a king and prophet, a very capable politician and warrior. Musically talented, wrote many psalms. Bible doesn't use phrase "man after the heart of God" on anyone else. Why so much recognition to David? Laid foundation for Isreal. King for forty years, nation prospered. He was an example. Up to today, David's symbol is symbol of Israel.

Many good aspects.

1 chr 22:6-8
Why David wasn't allowed to build the temple. Shed too much blood, and when Solomon ascended throne there would be peace to build it. God is omniscient. He has His own timing. David later committed adultery and sword wouldn't leave his house. Sons all vied for throne,  siblings incest - kingdom not stable. When Solomon ascended that was the most appropriate time. But David heart - he wasn't discouraged when not allowed to build the temple. 

1 chr 22:1-3
He made preparations. He wasn't discouraged when though not the one to build it - didn't just stop since he wouldn't lay foundation. Active in preparing materials - clearly loved God. Man who loves God wouldn't take into consideration whether he can do the work, but whether he can participate in helping out. Work done by son but he still thought it a great grace. 

2 Sam 7:18-20
He felt it was a Great grace to participate. Do we have this kind of mentality? Should we feel gratitude to be able to participate in the work of building the temple? Would we also emulate David who put in much effort to prepare the materials? Put in heart and effort. 

Everyone in church today - redeemed by blood of Jesus to rebuild the spiritual temple of the last day's. Can we be like David - felt it was such a joy to be able to participate. 


David was. Very important participant in this work. 

1 chr 22:1-5, 28:11,12-19, 
The whole plan was given to David by God . This is his response who felt gratitude to receive this plan. 

For every Christian, we have been called and chosen. He has given the blueprint for spiritual temple to us. Have we put our hear mind soul to do the work? Do we feel it's a great grace to participate or find it a burden? Or that we don't need to participate, just come and spectate here is enough. 
David didn't have this mentality. Even though not the one to carry out the work, he was nonetheless involved. 

1 kings 6:38
7 years. But 7:1 his own house took 13 years. Don't question why. Magnificent palace but 7 years because David made all the plans and material preparations. 
If we see what rehoboam said, his father Solomon placed heavy burden on them. But spirit of David wasn't just to???, he esteemed it. We might not be leader. Some are discouraged when not asked to do it, and just say oh okay entrust to God lor. Excuse and pull out of the work since not entrusted to them, discouraged and don't participate. Learn from spirit of David. 

Some are not very old, will sy I've done enough and let the young ppl do. Retired, won't do any work in churchand stop participating in church work. But David kept making preparations. Son Will do but keep supporting. Attitude we ought to learn. If we have such an attitude only then will the church truly prosper. 

Esteem it. 


Psa 90:16-17
Moses struck rock and couldn't enter. Doing the work he suffered much from the people, even asked for death from God. Writing this psalm he still praises God. Not allowed to enter but not discouraged, he continued to believe in the promise . Didn't say I'm not allowed to enter so not bother about it. 

How he was great  was he wasn't concerned about own benefit or fame or hopes and achievements, just wanted God's work to continue on to future generations. When He said Joshua would take over, even though not allowed to enter, his heart already entered land of Canaan. Died on peripheral but he knew that God is faithful and would bring them in to Canaan and complete the work. 

As Christians of tjc, we must look at establishment of kingdom of God from wider view. Remember that for each of us to participate is a grace. Don't be calculating about who is the leader. Some works even after we die might not finish. Moses didn't see the ppl enter land or Canaan but wasn't discouraged. He had same entrusting as David had to Solomon - continued to pray for the passing on of the faith to the next generation. Tjc today has established four venues in Singapore. Is it by our effort? We might have participated in some work but our predecessors - their attitude and continual participation to build temple - without them we can't enjoy this beautiful church building either. If not for their faith would God have been with them to build the church. 

View establishment of tjc from wider angle - our hearts will be wider as well. Then will have spirit of Moses and David. Will do utmost. Whatever we can't do we will entrust to God, and not be discouraged or give up or murmur. 

When we look at David participating in building temple, he was active. 

They died but spirit lived on. This spirit is something every member should emulate. Have we put in time money and effort for the work weve been called for? We occupy a short moment of history but did we make use of it to participate in the work to do it well? 

More importantly, need to pass on faith to next generation. For church to reach this stage today is because of many peoples effort behind the scenes. 


Don't focus of external environment or weaknesses we have but on God above. Put in effort and time then God knows or effort and labors. 

How should we work? Have we lost our strength? Tjc only church that saves do we say yes with confidence or doubt? We don't see the developments in work of God and lose faith - ask God to add to our faith. Elijah when battling the false prophets - great faith when fire and rain from his prayers but they didn't turn back and Jezebel chase then his faith collapsed. Moment when he was weak - humans are weak. Ppl didn't repent, work didn't achieve what he envisioned - compared self to fathers (not as great). God told him later to anoint Elisha, two others were pointed out to accomplish his work. He was disappointed but this didn't stop the work of God. What should we do when disappointed - listen to soft voice of God. Elijah hiding in cave and God used a still small voice to tell him to go on. Why didn't God accomplish it during time of Elijah - not time to be finished. We cannot fully understand will of God. He told him still 7000 not bowed - God still works behind the scenes. Don't focus in external problems. 

Barnabas Zhang said peace, no third world War would come. His own will above God, own vision of what to happen - became a false prophet because didn't wait for time of God, went ahead, went mad. Wrote letters to leaders. 

He sold everything, traveled so far to preach in hunger but fell because did it for own glory. Crowned himself. 

Moses and David  weren't like that. David continued to pray for work of temple and prepared materials for the temple - the spirit we ought to adopt. 

Spirit of his faith dies means spirit is dead - nothing worse than apathy, heart dying. Zombie, no life in him. Don't lose the right spirit and mentality. We are temple of God - as we build our own temple, entrust to God. Can we build it relying on own strength? No, weakness in flesh, need HS and word of God to strengthen us and motivate us. But need to let it enter our hearts. Must submit to God and allow His word to guide us. 

Don't just participate in church work, build up ourselves as well, don't be discouraged and give up when weak, lift up hands to pray. 


When building, inquire and entrust to His hands. Jesus broke body to establish temple for us not own sake. If we are not suing to entrust and build it up and don't think of it as grace, just hide in cave being discouraged, we are not entrusting to God.
