2 Sam 7:1-7
These verses record the conversation between David and Nathan. The background: because David did according to the will of God, God gave him rest from all his enemies all around. David loved the Lord. 

David was dwelling in his house. He didn’t consider his own comfort but considered the ark of the covenant instead. This isn’t what Man would usually do; humans tend to forget others when they’re rich and only rely on God when they’re in trouble. Whether in trouble or prosperity, David entrusted to God. 

David intended to build a temple for God. On the surface, this seems like a good thing. “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the God dwells inside tent curtains.” Note that David didn’t think of building a temple at first, but the contrast between where he dwelled and where the ark of God dwelled. It was Nathan that encouraged David, saying, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you.”

Why did Nathan say the Lord was with David?
1 Chron 12:21-22
At that time, David has many mighty men of valour. He was a prosperous man, and his men were like the army of God. 

The intent of David was extremely good, but what’s good may not be according to the will of God. This is something we may overlook and hence need to take note of. 

David’s want to build a temple for God was of good intent, but it wasn’t God’s will; he didn’t seek it. David was a King, Nathan was a prophet, but in the matter of building a temple, neither thought to inquire of God. 

2 Sam 7:4
The word of God was against what 2 people meant to do. They had good intention but the will of God was for them not to do so. What can we see from this incident? Hidden in the heart of men is the neglect of considering God’s will. When Man does according to his will and doesn’t inquire of God, he doesn’t consider God’s will. L

“But it happened that night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan...”
Why did God only speak at night? Why didn’t He speak up while they were making their plans? God has His timing, that we may not understand. 

David wanted to build a temple for God, but God didn’t want him to do it. 

Today, we may have a heart of gratitude and want to serve God in something. But let us consider the will of God, lest we act out of the will of men. 

Prophet Nathan told David he could do according to his heart, making him act like a false prophet. In the Old Testament, if the word of God doesn’t come upon his prophets, they don’t know anything; they aren’t supposed to say as they wish. Why then did Nathan say, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you.”? He committed the mistake of looking at Man and not inquiring of God. 

This happened even though David was a king and Nathan was a prophet who should’ve known clearly that his responsibility was to inquire of God. 

David didn’t inquire of God in times of peace. Why didn’t David inquire of God? Perhaps because he thought he had the support of the prophet. While the prophet thought David had the abidance of God. Since there was mutual support, there was no need to inquire of God. One of them should have suggested inquiring of God, and God would’ve given them the answer. The king has the responsibility to ask the prophet to inquire of God for him. The prophet has the responsibility to inquire of God. 

Deut 17:17 records that a king must copy the word of God, he should be familiar with the word of God. The prophet even more so!

But with regards to building the temple, both forgot the importance of inquiring of God. They didn’t entrust to God. 

Even when we do good things, we need to inquire of God. Only when we ask of God will we know whether we are acting according to His will. 

The Bible gives us clear instructions. We can also pray for God to guide us. Often, God won’t speak, because His words are in the Bible. It’s hence important to remind each other whether what we’re doing is according to His will. 

How could a king and a religious leader neglect such an important thing of inquiring of the Lord?

Was this the first case of neglect? Recall the matter of moving the ark of the covenant. They didn’t inquire of God either. 
2 Sam 6:7-9
This incident happened before David intended to build the temple. He wanted to bring the ark of covenant to Jerusalem, with the intention of letting God rest there. 

Why was God angry and strike Uzzah? The ark of the covenant was to be carried by Levites and not transported by cart. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah stretched out his hand and took hold of it. Seems like a good act. But God’s will is different from the will of Man. God stated that no one was to touch the ark of the covenant. A Levite should know that. 

This incident affected David so much, he didn’t dare for the ark of the covenant into the City of David. His intent of moving the ark was good, but it wasn’t according to God’s will. 

1 Chron 13:1-3
When David wanted to bring the ark of covenant into Jerusalem, he consulted with the captains of thousands and hundred, and with every leader. They all agreed and thought it was a good thing. Ironically, the motive of bringing the ark of the covenant into the city of David was to inquire of God (v3). But they didn’t inquire God whether they should move it. 

1 Chron 15:13
David reflected on himself after Uzzah was struck. “We did not consult Him about the proper order”

Because they didn’t inquire of God, they didn’t know what His will was and consequently incurred His wrath. 

Is our worship of God only on our lips or also in our hearts?

2 Sam 7:6
God doesn’t dwell in a house. People tend to have a very physical idea of God’s presence. They forget His omnipresent. The physical temple doesn’t guarantee God’s abidance. Inquiring of Him and doing His will is. 

In Eli’s time, they thought taking the ark of the covenant into battle would guarantee victory. Instead, they lost and the ark of the covenant was captured. Why wasn’t God with Eli? He honoured his sons higher than God. Also, they had the misconception that the ark being physically present meant God would abide with them.

Why didn’t God allow David to build a temple for Him then? We understand it’s because David had shed much blood. 

1 Kings 8:18-19
It was God’s will for David’s SON to build the temple, not David. 

There was another reason why God didn’t allow David to build the temple.
1 Kings 5:3
At that time, David was still fighting wars. God didn’t intend for a temple to be built during a time where war was still ongoing. But during Solomon’s time, there was peace.  God has His time and candidates/人选. 

From this incident of David wanting to build the temple, we learn from what Paul said in Rom 12:2 “do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”

Don’t look at the will of Man, but the will of God. David was a man after the heart of God but also made the mistake of not doing according to the will of God. Ought we not to be more vigilant?

Let us not be like Nathan either to look at Man instead of God. 

Mark 9:5-8
See no one but Jesus. When Peter witnessed the transfiguration on there Mount, he was so mesmerised that he spoke nonsense. He wanted to build 3 tabernacles, one for Moses one for Elijah and one for Jesus. But that wasn’t according to God’s will. God’s will was to look to Jesus. The voice that came out of the cloud had said, “This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!”

When Jesus said He would be taken to Jerusalem and crucified, Peter rebuked Jesus and said He wasn’t to go. They neglected the will of God and esteemed their own will. 

Acts 16:6-7
“they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia”
“After...they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them”

Paul wanting to preach was of course good. But even Paul didn’t inquire of God in this matter. He targeted big cities. Little did he know he would be told by the Spirit to go to Macedonia to preach to just one family. But it was from this one family that the church grew. 

Today, in our lives of faith and in our careers, do we inquire of God?

A testimony:
A sister came here to work. She didn’t know where True Jesus Church was. She prayed to God realised the house she stayed at was 5min away from the church. She later bore testimony that when she walked out of the house was to pray to God to get to church. 

Whenever we do something, we ought to inquire of God. 

Num 10:33, 35-36
In every step Moses took, he sought God’s guidance, because God knows the way ahead. 

By inquiring of God, it shows our trust and reliance on God. 

Is God still our God? Or do we treat ourselves as God?
