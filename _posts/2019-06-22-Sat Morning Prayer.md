Welcome to the garden of prayer. In particular, the first prayer of the Spiritual Meeting is most apt to be called the garden of prayer. Of course each time we gather to pray is the garden of prayer, but other prayers in the afternoon have more people. 

The speaker likes this hymn to be sung in the morning because we often don’t realise Jesus is waiting in the garden of prayer for us. It’s a privilege to be able to come to the garden of prayer. 

Sometimes we think too much: I’ve come for so many Spiritual Meetings and have received nothing. But receiving an invitation to this heavenly feast itself is a grace. 

Imagine having JESUS waiting for us. Imagine having Jesus WANTING to meet us. Isn’t that such a wonderful feeling?

Sometimes we find it so difficult to have discipline in our lives. Discipline to wake up and pray in the morning. But if we were to think about it, if we were going to meet someone very important that morning, would we wake up? If we were going to meet some star (Korean, soccer) we’ve always wanted to meet and get their signature, even if you live in Jurong West and the star lands at Changi airport, you’d still be there. 

If your loved one is waiting, if your bf/gf asks to meet in the morning to walk and then have breakfast, if you’re in the depth of love, you probably won’t be able to sleep the whole night. You’d probably get up at 5. “How come today sleep so long ah? Only half an hour has passed? Only 6h more to go.” You’re supposed to get up 6 but you get up at 4 because you’re so excited. 

There’s a garden where Jesus is waiting. We often say we’re Christians. We do believe in Jesus. Yet somehow over time, our longing for Jesus may have become dilute. We may be distracted by many many things in our lives. If within our normal day, we find it difficult to adjust our thoughts, let’s make good use of this Spiritual Meeting time to realign our lives. 

Luke 10:38-41
This passage isn’t talking about prayer per se, but it’s underlying message is still relevant for our prayer. 

When Jesus came into the village, a certain woman, Martha, welcomed Him to her house. When He was in there teaching, her sister Mary sat quietly at His feet listening intently to His teachings. While Martha, on the other hand, was so busy and distracting preparing things. She was so distracted that after a while, she got flustered and frustrated. To the extent, she came to complain to Jesus. “Jesus don’t you care? My sister is just sitting there listening and not helping me!”

Take note of what Jesus replied.
v41 “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.”

Sometimes the speaker wonders why some of us pray for the Holy Spirit for such a long time, but we may not have received the Holy Spirit. Why is it that very often, it is during theological courses that the most number of people receive the Holy Spirit generally? And then the next is probably the Bible camps. Theological courses usually last about 3 weeks, Bible camps 5 days. Next comes probably Spiritual Meetings: 3 days. There are fewer who receive in regular prayers. Why?

What the speaker is going to say isn’t the only formula/reason, but it is probably one of the contributing reasons. Because we often see people who are younger receiving the Holy Spirit earlier in their lives. Later on when they are grown up adults, there’s just too much happening in their lives, it becomes too difficult. 

During the theological seminars, it’s 3 full weeks where the children are in church, reading the Bible everyday, praying multiple times a day, no TV/phones/distractions. By week 2/3, people receive the Holy Spirit. They’re able to enter into a state where their focus is on their spiritual lives and God.

It’s not easy, because we human beings are often ill disciplined in our lives. Some of us get bored very easily, so our minds wander away. Some of us lack focus. It’s not that their minds wander away, their minds are like dead: thinking about and doing nothing. 

How many of us can really sit and focus the whole day? Maybe some of us sitting here are already wondering what kind of breakfast we’ll be having later, because our stomachs are grumbling inside lol

Ask ourselves: are we distracted by many things? Especially in the modern world, where we’re living in a city as hectic as Singapore. Our minds are indeed distracted by many many things. There’re many things that we want. It may not be obvious, but it’s embedded deep in our hearts. 

Matt 19:20-22
This young man was actually very doubt, he was one who took his faith/religion very seriously. That’s why he came to seek Jesus on his own to ask what he should do to gain eternal life. Jesus told him to keep the commandments. He checked himself and thought: fantastic! I’ve kept all these commandments from his youth. So he was a good guy. But he went on to ask Jesus, which shows how serious he still was, “What so I still lack?” Jesus told him, “Go sell everything you have. Give to the poor and follow Me.” He went away sorrowful. He didn’t know that embedded in his heart, there was still the love of his possessions that surpassed his love for the Lord. This was something he was unwilling to give up. He didn’t know before that, but Jesus wanted to point that out. 

What is ours? It may not be possessions. It may be something else. Something that unknowingly has become a stumbling block in your life. 

When the speaker was praying for the Holy Spirit, he thinks he was quite a complicated guy when he was teenager. He thought about and worried about many things. He wanted to do many things: studies, sports, committees in schools. He wanted to be a winner in everything. But he didn’t receive the Holy Spirit. But when he found God, there was one prayer during student theological course (he had prayed for so long and didn’t receive), a realisation hit him. He told God, “God I now realise. All my trophies are not important. I don’t want them anymore. Just give me the Holy Spirit.” God fulfilled his request because after that he didn’t do that well in school LOL. He still managed to get on but not like in the past. But whatever he had lost, he felt like he gained much much more in Christ. So the speaker often says to people, “I’m a very simple man. I know many people don’t believe that. I’m a simple man not a simpleton.” While he can understand certain complex things, he chooses not to think and complicate things too much. Be simple in our faith in that sense. Don’t be a fool that doesn’t understand the word of God. At the same time, let’s not over complicate our lives and think too much. It’s because of our deep understanding of God that we learn to entrust. Let’s put away our distractions. Focus only on one thing: the Holy Spirit.
