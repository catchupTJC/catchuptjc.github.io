A caveat: apart from the New Testament writers, none of the ministers are inspired. If we use the word inspire loosely e.g. “I have no inspiration!”, that’s okay. But when we talk about being inspired in the truth, that only occurs for people who wrote the Bible. So no minister is inspired. No sermon is inspired in that sense. But we can say we are guided by the Spirit. 

The speaker says this to correct a mistake he made. He uses this opportunity to define himself as a minister and his sermons. Don’t take him to be an inspired authority; that we have to obey everything they say. 

Earlier, the speaker said Adam and Eve weren’t created on the same day but died on the same day. That’s a half truth. They were created on the same day but at different times. Both were created on the 6th day. So we should perhaps say, “Because we were created on the same day, we want to die on the same day!” That’s what happened to Adam and Eve. 

But to Christian couples, we may be born on different days, but the important thing is that we must always be on the same path. Always pace each other. Encourage each other to walk the same pace. How can a family grow together if a husband and wife don’t grow at the same pace? 

Now the second instalment if soulmates in the Lord: beyond romance. 

Christians should marry Christians. But when Christians marry Christians, it doesn’t guarantee their marriage will be blessed. Marrying the right husband/wife is just the first step, there’s a long way to go. So to be soulmates, one together, it’s not just a fleshly but also a spiritual relationship. 

It goes beyond what other couples do. It’s beyond romance. 

Gen 2:24
A man should cleave to his wife and become one flesh. One flesh is clearly a relationship that is to be limited to the husband and wife. If two persons become one flesh outside marriage, that’s not a rightful relationship. Because a man is to be joined to HIS WIFE, not any other woman. 

1 Cor 6:17
“But he who Holy Spirit joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.”
Genesis talks about one flesh. Here talks about another relationship. When you marry somebody, you become one flesh. When you’re baptised, you become one spirit with the Lord. One flesh is between husband and wife. One spirit is between a believer and the Lord. 

1 Sam 18:1
Here talks about souls knitted together. We’ve talked about one flesh and one spirit. Here doesn’t talk about one soul though. It’s not like Egyptian mythology. One flesh, husband and wife. One spirit, believer in the Lord. Two souls knitted together - what does this mean? LGBT? The speaker won’t dwell too much on this. People have used this to say Jonathan and David were gay lovers. “See the two souls were knitted together. See he loved him as his own soul! What a loving couple.”

Did you know in a marriage vow, it says “till death do us part”? Do you know where it’s taken from? The book of Ruth. This is what Ruth said to her mother-in-law Naomi. The lesbian community then says Ruth and Naomi are lesbians lol

The problem is that sometimes people use the Bible wrongly, lifting verses out of context and using it in marriage vows. Did True Jesus Church do it? Yes, but we repented lol. “Till death do us part” has been taken out. It’s enough to say we’ll obey the teachings of the Lord all the days of our lives. 

Back to David and Jonathan. Jonathan loved David’s soul as his own. It is holy friendship. We have many friendships in the world but not many are holy. Why was their friendship holy? (cf. Holy Matrimony). Because their friendship was in honour of God. They also made a covenant with each other. The gays claim this shows they’re gay. Yes they made a covenant, but what kind?

Why did Jonathan love David and make a covenant with David?

1 Sam 20:8 says it’s a covenant of the Lord. No LGBT. 

1 Sam 23:16-18
The covenant was to help David fulfil the will of God. David was already anointed king, nor just once but twice or thrice. Because God had already rejected Saul. Just that Saul was still on the throne, awaiting God’s timing to remove him. David wouldn’t usurp the throne. David also wouldn’t become a rebel to leave the palace and form his own kingdom. David fled from Saul because Saul wanted to kill him. The team he led away wasn’t a rebel team but a refugee team. 

What did Jonathan do? Wherever David was, he went there to strengthen him in the Lord. His covenant with David was a mutual agreement. “I know the will of God is for you to be king. Even though I’m the heir of the throne, you are to be king. I forsake my natural heritage to the throne and obey God’s will. Let me be by your side. If I die, take care of my family.”

That’s why Saul scolded Jonathan, “As long as the son of David lives, you will never become king.”

Why did Jonathan love David so much? Also ask ourselves: what’s so lovable about David? 
Who loved David? God. 

1 Sam 13:14 (read)
Why did God love David? Because David was a man after His own heart. Here David is being contrasted with Saul who didn’t keep the Lord’s commandments. David was one who obeyed the Lord’s commandments. Jonathan chose David to be king instead of himself. 

1 Sam 20:30-31
Saul knew that his son Jonathan wanted to give up the kingdom, because Jonathan knew God’s will. That’s the friendship he had with David. A different kind of love. Not romantic love. There’s a term the speaker doesn’t really like: bromance lol. 
The speaker calls this noble love instead. Because it surpasses romance. 

2 Sam 1:26
Saul and his sons (including Jonathan) fought against Israel’s enemies and died in battle. David was going to be king. This was how God removed Saul from the throne. David was very very mournful. He mourned for Saul and Jonathan, more so for Jonathan. 
“I am distressed for you my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me; your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women.”

LGBT people jump on this and say this is evidence of them being gay. David already had two women in his life. One was the daughter of Saul. Michal’s love is so very far below Jonathan’s love. That’s what David meant - the nobility of Jonathan’s love. There’s no vested interest. “We’re both fulfilling the will of God together. Therefore I love you as one who fulfils the love of God with me.”

A couple with a strong relationship does not just have romance. On top of romance, a married couple should progress to become best friends. If Jonathan and David could become best friends, then why can’t soulmates/married couples become best friends? When couples become best friends, their marriage will be doubly secure. It’s important for people to have the similar brainwaves, a tacit understanding.

David had two women in his life that contrast with each other in the aspect of brainwaves. Both know the Lord. That’s why having a Christian marriage in the Lord doesn’t guarantee a blessed marriage. Also needs similar brainwaves. But not evil brainwaves like Ananias and Sapphira lol. 

The first woman of David was called Michal. She went from desire to disdain. She was so desirous of David. 
1 Sam 18:20
Jonathan loved David. Michal too. In one chapter, brother and sister fell for David. Seems like really good LGBT fanfiction lol. 

1 Sam 18:27-28
David was a valiant soldier. Michal was filled with admiration for him. Saul saw this was because the Lord was with him. He saw that his son loved David. God loved David. His daughter loved David. So he became very afraid of David.  The love his daughter had for David must have been very strong such that it affected Saul. 

While Jonathan’s love for David was so/soul deep, Michal’s love for him was skin deep. Although she became David’s wife and also helped to save David from Saul (1 Sam 19:11-16 She put things under the cover and fake hair so it seemed David was in bed while she led him out the window); she loved David so much that she defied the father like Jonathan; seemed to love David like Jonathan but her soul was never connected to David’s like Jonathan’s was 

2 Sam 6:17
She despised David FROM THE HEART. Her soul is so very different from David’s soul. Can you imagine how much the ark of the covenant meant to David? He had attempted to bring the ark of the covenant once and failed. When he finally succeeded, and she looked out of the window (hopefully not the same window she let him out of; that was her window of love), the window became a window of despisal. Despised him from the bottom of her heart. Why? Just because David was whirling before the Lord. What did she say?

v20-23 David was so happy. 
Sometimes your husband may be so happy to announce something to you when he returns home but you greet him with an angry/sour face. He wanted something very much and he finds it, “Look at what I found today! Tada!”

David was so happy. And Michal says, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering Himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the BASE FELLOWS shamelessly uncovers himself!”

Her heart was not connected with his. From the booth of his heart, he was so joyous. From the bottom of her heart, she hurled insults at him. 

If you want your husband to divorce you, start being sarcastic lol. 

Was it wrong for David to do this? It was so important to him, one of the most important things in his life. Because he didn’t want to be king for himself but for the Lord. Yet his wife didn’t understand him. 

David’s answer, “It was before the Lord...and I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight.”

Sometimes we may think: Deacon leh. How come he wash toilet? Deacons must always be in the limelight. Why must you always drop them home? They cannot take bus ah?” We shouldn’t despise our husband for doing such things. 

v23 “Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.”
The reason God made 2 individuals 1 was for them to have godly offspring. Michal wasn’t able to bear that. It’s unsure whether God closed her womb or David didn’t want to be with her anymore.

Let’s look at the second woman: matching the mismatched. She was matched with the wrong man, then he died. She was later matched to the right person; her soulmate. 

1 Sam 25:2-3
Nabal was a harsh and evil man. But the wife Abigail was of good understanding and beautiful appearance. She was good outside and inside. But this man was bad on the inside - evil, and harsh on the inside. 

v4-13
Nabal made a fatal move. David wanted to kill him. God wanted to protect David. In the process, people of Israel helped (Jonathan, those who followed him, etc.)

God gave Nabal the opportunity to be David’s helper. Because David helped Nabal by protecting his flock, he asked for some food. But Nabal said, “There’re so many servants who run away from their masters. Who is this David? Am I to help all of them?” David was so angry he wanted to kill him, because he reckoned Nabal insulted God. Nabal didn’t know David was already anointed king. 

Abigail quickly interceded. 
v19 says she didn’t tell this to her husband. Husband and wives are supposed to be soul mates right? She didn’t tell Nabal because they couldn’t connect. 

When she met David, she gave a very frank opinion of her husband (v25). This intelligent wise wife couldn’t connect with a foolish evil husband. 

So she did not tell him. Husbands and wives shouldn’t keep things from each other. Got to make it right.  

1 Sam 25:26-31 (read)
Such a wise woman. The first thing she said was, “Thank God the Lord has preventing you from shedding blood and avenging yourself.” This is in contrast with Bathsheba. Because of Bathsheba, another beauty, David shed innocent blood. But here Abigail stopped him from shedding innocent blood. She knows and accepts God’s will. This is shown in the next thing she says, “May all your enemies be like Nabal.” Seems like cursing her husband. She didn’t come just to save her own life. David only came to kill the men, she would’ve been spared. She only came to save innocent blood from being shed. She also accepted the will of God. She said David’s battle was fighting for the Lord, not his own. So different from Michal, much like Jonathan. She knew since he was fighting the Lord’s battle, he would be victorious. She also was wise to seek for her own by asking David to remember her (v31). She eventually became his wife and bore him a son.

In conclusion:
Husbands and wives must be soulmates. To Mary the right person, not only should they have the Same kind of faith but also the same quality of faith. For those of us still unmarried, don’t look at the outside. Look at the inside, whether they can be soulmates with you. Don’t be like Ananias and Sapphira. Be like Priscilla and Aquila; they were clearly soulmates. They served the Lord together. They’re clearly soulmates because in the Bible they’re never mentioned individually without the other. 

Amos 3:3
To walk the heavenly path, many things to do. Husband and wife must sit together and agree on many things. Not like Ananias and Sapphira. Use the Bible as a guide. Discuss with each other to reach an agreement. Serve God in this manner. Live your life to glorify God in this manner.
