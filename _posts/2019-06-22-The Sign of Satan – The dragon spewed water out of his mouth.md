The six visions of revelation 12
1)	The revelation of the true church
2)	The vision of satan
3)	The vision of the true church 
4)	The sign of satan – dragon spewing water out of its mouth
What is the significance of the water? Who is this dragon?

Rev 12: 15-16
-	The third persecution faced by the church
-	The enemy is unseen which makes this more dangerous
-	The previous persecutions were blatant where satan appeared 

In verse 13-14, the dragon pursued the woman who was then given the two wings of a great eagle.

The woman flew for running was no longer enough to outpace temptation/persecution – if not, she would have likely been devoured by this dragon.

The devil had changed his tactics for he changed from a dragon into a serpent. From a creature so glorious into a something more stealthy
 
The devil will adapt and find ways to persecute us – they are no one-trick poney. The devil may appear in many forms to deceive us be it even in the form of what appears to be a ‘good person’.

2 Cor 11: 13-14
Satan will deceive us with false prophets, deceitful workmen and even masquerading as an angel of light.

Back to Rev 12, the serpent hid behind the woman and spew water like a river. No longer was the devil appearing so blatantly to deceive the woman – the devil has certainly learned from its failures.

Rev 2 : 13-14
Satan is in fact within the church even. 
We may say that there are no dragons in this church when in fact, it has transformed into a serpent. 

The church needs to be protected from such evil influences. Blind faith is also a crutch to the church.

We often observe or hear of people praying in rather extreme forms; foaming of the mouth, collapsing to the ground.
-	Are these truly prayers from God?

Remember, the devil will appear as a serpent and even manifest itself within the church. 

Referring to the earlier persecution, it mentions that the snake spew water. Spew is in reference to how much the devil hates the church. It also can be referred to as blaspheming the church. 

The True Jesus Church is often blasphemed but it is for our commitment to the accordance of the bible. 

Make no mistake, the water spewed is from the mouth of the dragon – nothing good comes out of it.

The church could easily conform to the norms of other Christian practices but where is the truth then? The true church never changes.

The church is no stranger to receiving attacks. It draws back all the way to apostolic times. We are a copy of these apostolic churches referred to in the bible. 
-	Our doctrines are according to the apostolic churches and the apostolic churches receive their teachings from Jesus.
Acts 28: 22
-	There will be talking against the church

Rev 13: 5-6
The beast was given the authority to blaspheme the name of God, His dwelling place and those who live in heaven for forty two months. 
-	God is in fact in referring to Jesus
-	Dwelling place is referred to the tabernacle or the church.
-	Those who live in heaven for earth isn’t our eternal resting place.

There is a reason as to why the devil changed into a serpent and swept it with water. It may not be the entire church that falls but as long as they get a few believers, its considered a success for them.

If we allow the spew to become a river, then that poses a danger if the foundation is not strong.
What does it mean to sweep the woman? 
-	Our faith must be rooted sufficiently or we won’t overcome the torrent from the river and float along with it

The devil will not attempt to scare you – this method doesn’t work against the True Jesus Church.

The attack will come in its most basic form – challenging the doctrines, not keeping the commandments, etc.
It starts as a spew but if allow it to manifest, it will turn to a river.

The water refers to the trends or views of the world. 
Again the water comes from the mouth of the dragon.

1 Tim 4: 1
The spirit has prophesized that people will leave the church for the doctrines of the devil. 

2 Tim 4: 3
What do these ‘sound’ doctrines refer to? It’s the truth bestowed by Jesus. 
People will turn their backs against it to suit their own desires. 

People will say why do we speak of the same things over and over again. How can the truth change?
Teachings that deviate from the teachings of God is dragon spew. 

An example of this, the topic of homosexuality. In the past they were in hiding but today the LGBT movement is something to be proud of. 
In the eyes of the church, homosexuality is a great sin.
But today, speaking against it is frowned upon with society claiming to be depriving them of their rights. 

This in particular is turning from a spew into a river current.
If the church dare not speak up, then the church is already defiled by satan. 

Even at the risk of being unpopular or with threats – we have to stick in accordance to the bible
Paul was persecuted and imprisoned during his missionary journey for preaching the gospel – are we willing to do the same today?

Rev 12: 16
The woman was saved by the earth for it had opened its mouth and swallowed the river. 
‘The earth’ can be rather tricky to translate. Could this be in reference to the government? The police? - NO
Let us look at the context. The woman stood on land that was protected by the church. When we worship in the name of God, the institution is then protected by God.

Wherever Jesus is, there lies the kingdom of God.
In the past we often cast out demons. On one occasion while casting out a demon, the possessed demon then spoke to him saying “where does he go?”

The world belongs to the devil and it will simply reappear elsewhere. However, wherever God is there is the kingdom of God.

Luke 12: 11-12
Do not need to worry how you will defend yourself for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.
In the past, the Israelites that left Egypt and tried to bring down Moses were dealt with by the Lord.
This is the third persecution faced by the church.
Be wary of the deceitfulness of the devil. 

The fourth persecution continued in verse 17. The dragon almost won until God intervened. In rage, the dragon went off to make war against the rest of her offspring.

These offspring are the ones that keep the commandment of the Lord. The dragon will continue to pursue and is relentless.
The offspring who did not go through the same persecutions as the mother will definitely be prey for the devil.

It is important that we ensure the pillars of our church don’t fall and likewise, the future generation of the church.
