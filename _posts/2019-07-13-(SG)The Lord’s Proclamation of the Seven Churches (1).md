Revelation is a letter instructed by the Lord to be written to the 7 churches by John.

There weren’t just 7 churches. For example, the church of Colosse which was near the church of Laodecia. Why was the letter only written to 7 then? 7 represents completeness or perfectness. The conditions of the 7 churches also represented the conditions of all the churches then. Revelation is hence not just written to the 7 churches but all the churches of the world, including the last church in the last days. We’re able to see the words written to the 7 churches, and the names He calls Himself to each church. Each name has its own significance and it is important because it regards our salvation and lives. 

1. Ephesus “He who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks in the midst of the golden lampstands”  
Rev 2:1  
The golden lampstands represents the churches (Rev 1:20b). However the 7 churches then were so imperfect, which was why they were rebuked by the Lord. Only 2 out of 7 were not rebuked. The rest were severely rebuked. The rest of the 5 were like metal scraps; why were they still known as golden lampstands then? The golden lampstands refers to the perfect establishment of the church. At the moment, the church is undergoing construction. No wonder we see so much imperfection. Therefore let us not murmur or be disheartened when we see the imperfections of the church before us. Rather, let us hold fast and work hard as we look forward to the glorious church that will be perfect. When a lampstand is used to represent the church, the church needs to shine forth.

A church that doesn’t shine forth should be removed. What should it shine forth? The light of the gospel in a dark and sinful world to deliver the people into the Kingdom of God - the church. Therefore the most important work is not just for the church to worship God but to shine forth and preach the gospel. 

For a lampstand to shine forth, it needs oil. The Lord’s lampstand needs the Lord’s oil which is the spirit of truth. Only with the spirit of truth will she be able to shine forth the light of the gospel in the dark world. Therefore we who are redeemed ought to shine forth to people so they may be able to come to the Lord too. 

The Lord also walks in the midst of the golden lampstands. ‘Walks’ is in present tense. This shows He is presently walking in the midst of the church. 

How do we know God is walking in the midst of the church now? Some people say: I come to church but I don’t feel the presence of God!

“Don’t you hear people speaking in tongues when you come?”  
These people speak in tongues because of the Holy Spirit. Perhaps we might think they’re faking it. But why’re adults and people with status in society do likewise? They’re not fools and they aren’t muddleheaded. Why then do they still speak in tongues? 

This testifies of the abidance of the Holy Spirit, which shows the Lord abides with us. The speaking in tongues in prayers hence shows God is in our midst. When we realise the Lord is walking in the midst of the church we will be comforted and have faith. 

Why are children able to sleep well and study in peace in their bedroom? Because they are able to hear the footsteps of their parents going about their household chores. If the rain comes, the parents will go into their rooms to close their windows and tuck them into bed. If they have a nightmare and scream out, the parents will immediately rush to their side to comfort them. 

In church, do we hear the footsteps of the Lord? Even though there are many weaknesses and problems in church, even though there is wind and rain, we know the Lord walks in the midst of the lampstands. He’ll watch over and protect His church. Even as the church is undergoing construction and we see many weaknesses, the Lord in our midst will help us to complete the work through the help of the Holy Spirit. 

As the Lord walks amidst the lampstands, He also watches over our conduct. Which lampstand shines, and which doesn’t. Some don’t shine but produces smoke. Smoke causes discomfort. We hence ought to examine ourselves. Are we a lampstand that only produces smoke and is unable to shine?

As we read the 7 letters to the 7 churches, He uses this phrase: I know your works. It’s not because someone told Him, He Himself knows because He walks in the midst of the lampstands. 

The Lord Jesus doesn’t just want to know our faith, He wants all the more to know our world. Don’t just be content and say we have faith. Because faith without works are dead. We hence also need to have works that manifest our faith. Because of this faith we are able to come before Jesus and worship Him on the Sabbath; because of our faith we’re able to kneeel reversely before Him and ask Him for help; because of this faith we’re able to insist on this faith and wait upon His second coming. Without such a faith, we won’t be able to manifest such works. 

He wants to see how we listen to His words. He wants to see how we do His work. 

Perhaps some believe God is walking in the midst of our church. But they believe Jesus is like an old man who has blurred vision unable to see our works and has dull ears unable to hear what we say. That’s why some believers are so haphazard in the way they behave. When unhappy, they throw their temper as if this was a marketplace and not the temple of the Lord. They don’t know the Lord walks in our midst. Or they know but they think Jesus is a loving and merciful grandpa who will say, “Aiya it’s ok he’s just a child!” Do we think Jesus is like that too? That’s why we feel it’s alright no matter how we behave ourselves?

This is why the Lord Jesus told John to write down what he sees so we are well aware what kind of a Lord He is as He walks in the midst of the church. 

Rev 1:12-16  
What kind of a Lord that walks in the midst of the golden lampstands did John see? “One like the Son of Man” (v13). This seems like John is unsure whether it was the Son of Man, but this isn’t the case. Instead, he was referring to one of the prophecies of Daniel. 

Dan 7:13 (read)  
The Son of Man is not an ordinary man, because He’s the son of God who has come to save the people of the world and also to judge the people of the world. The son of Man Daniel had seen is the one who will come in the clouds and judge the world. He will be brought before the ancient of days, and given all glory and dominion. All peoples and nations will serve Him. His dominion is everlasting. His kingdom won’t be destroyed. But they didn’t know who this Son of Man was. When Jesus came, He proclaimed He was this Son of Man. He has come to serve and not to be served. He has been killed and completed salvation grace. Then He resurrected and ascended to the right hand of God. He established the church and through it spread the gospel to all peoples and nations. His kingdom will be everlasting and won’t be destroyed. When Jesus comes again in the clouds, this church will be taken into heaven. We HAVE to see this Lord is one who judges. One day, He’ll come in the clouds to judge. 

Rev 1:7 (read)  
We refer to the time Jesus was crucified. At that time He was truly betrayed by friends and relatives. Who stood at the foot of the cross? His mother and other women. And only John amongst the disciples. How the people persecuted and laughed at him! “Didn’t you claim to be the Saviour? Save Yourself first! Come down from the cross and we will all worship You!” But Jesus died. This assured them He was a fake. A soldier pierced His side as well, which shows how hardened his heart was. 

Now back to judgement day (Rev 1:7).  
There are people who don’t want to look at Jesus. But when He comes, even if they don’t want to come, they have no choice but to come. Their hardened hearts will be full of regrets. 

So let us not just look at what’s in front of us, we have to look at the last day. How ‘last’? Often we say we have to prepare for the future. Especially when we’re aged and have no one to take care of us. So we have to make preparations now. But is our future only restricted to when we’re old? The future after we die is even more important! Have we made preparations for that future which lasts forever?

You can choose to believe. Or choose not to believe. At that time many believers mocked: why would Jesus come again? The world is still so beautiful!

When we talk about the judgement day now, will we still believe?

Last time, there weren’t many preachers. Most sermons were a general exhortation. The speaker recalls when Elder Lai and Elder Lin came (they were deacons then) and they spoke of the last days. That was the first time the speaker heard of the last days. He had read about it in the Bible but listening to it on the pulpit was different - scarier. It really strikes your heart.

Which is why they were so earnest to pray for the Holy Spirit! “If tomorrow were the judgement day, would you pray in this manner??”

What are you to do? You haven’t received the Holy Spirit. If tomorrow was the last day, what are you to do?

Perhaps we have listened to too much on the last day so we become desensitised. We think: Aiyo again. 

Did we read what John added to Rev 1:7? “Even so, Amen.” 这还是真的，阿门

Whatever the case. Whether you believe or disbelieve, the Son of Man will come in the clouds. Blessed are those who believe and have prepared themselves. 

John saw He was like the Som of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. Wouldn’t we think to ourselves: yeah sounds like a kind merciful grandpa. 

Rev 1:14-15  
But if we look closer, we realise His eyes are like a flame of fire. His feet are like fine brass refined in a furnace. His voice as the sound of many wagers. If we take a closer look, this Lord is very majestic. Like a sun shining in its strength. When the sun is shining brightly in the sky, we are unable to look directly at it. This Lord is so majestic. Why does He manifest Himself in such a majestic image for us to see?

Because the churches see Him as a loving merciful old man. “We don’t need to fear. We can do what we want.” But we forget He is also a God who judges. The Lord walking in the midst of the lampstands is to tell us He is the Lord who judges. If we realise this we’ll have a heart of reverence, we’ll repent and be serious in our worship of Him. 

2 Cor 5:10-11  
Paul tells us here that the Lord is a terror. Often we say the Lord is lovable and one we respect. We seldom speak of the terror of the Lord. That’s why many people respect the Lord but don’t fear Him. It is the Lord terrifying? Because one day we will come before the judgement seat of Christ to be judged by Him. Each one will receive according to what he has done in the body. 

Today, the people of the world disregard what people say about what we do. “I can do what I want. I don’t need to care how others criticise me. The most important thing is that I’m happy. It’s useless if I’m not happy.” Perhaps we can choose to do this and are happy, but the Bible tells us we are able to see the things our eyes want to see or do, but what we see and do will be judged by the Lord. Be rest assured to do what we want and be happy. But after this, we have to meet with judgement. Will we still be happy? Will we still want this happiness? Just like people who crucified the Lord. When the Son of Man comes in the clouds, they’ll mourn. That’s why Jesus says not to mourn for Him but to mourn for themselves. 

Since we know our Lord is terrifying and that He’ll come one day, shouldn’t we lead a godly life today?

Back to Rev 2:  
The one who holds the seven stars in His right hand. Rev 1:20 tells us the seven stars are the messengers of the 7 churches. These refer to the elders, deacons and preachers. Note that these 7 stars are in the hands of the Lord. In other words, the messengers of the churches are under the control of the Lord. Therefore messengers of the churches should know they are not to do things according to their own way. It’s not them who holds authority but executes what the Lord commands. People submit to them because of the Lord who send him. Don’t raise your own status and cause others to obey and submit to you. Don’t bring Man before you but bring Man before God. Not to worship you but to worship the Lord. They are but messengers sent by the Lord to complete the work assigned to do. They should be the ones who should first listen and obey. They are just like believers who should be serious in repentance. They may be on the pulpit speaking a sermon now but once he comes down he too will be judged on the last day. When he speaks words of rebuke on the sermon, he speaks the words to himself too. If he can’t do the things he says to do in the sermon, how can the believers do so then? So he cuts out of the sermon. 

Pay special attention to our conduct. Just like ambassadors sent overseas. He represents our country. So he has to note how his conduct and speech will affect the country. His will doesn’t represent the will of the country. The will of the country should be represented by him. 

But often we forget about this representation. We have to be watchful over our conduct and speech because others will view our conduct and think our country is like that. 

Another thing to note: the 7 stars are placed in the RIGHT hand of the Lord. This shows it’s important and precious to Him. “He who serves Me will be honoured by even My Heavenly Father.” We’d never dare to make such a statement. But Jesus has spoken this on our behalf. The entire significance and meaning will be different. Perhaps we suffer much as we serve the Lord. Perhaps we have become poor or riddled in difficulties. Perhaps we have been attacked by others until we can’t lift our heads up. 

“Aren’t you a preacher/deacon/exco member?” Every believer will point their fingers at you. Why do you best with it then? For the Lord. That’s why you’re willing to serve the sheep of the Lord. Even if you’re reprimanded you will never give up because you’re doing all this for the sake of the Lord. If you don’t do this for the Lord, you’re truly pitiful. But if you do it for the Lord, it’s worth it. Not only is He in control, He also treasures you. And that’s enough. Isn’t it? 

What does the right hand mean? In the Bible, the right hand represents power (Exo 15:6-7). How is being in His right hand linked to us?

John 10:27-29 (read)  
The hand of the Lord is powerful. No one is able to be victorious over Him and no one can snatch us from Him. See the double guarantee? “No one shall snatch them out of My hand” “No one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.” It’s enough to have the guarantee of Jesus. Nonetheless He gives us the guarantee of the Father too. 

But we some believers/sheep have been snatched away by the devil or the world. Is it true that the protection of the Lord is insufficient then? If the protection is sufficient, why are these people snatched away? The crux of the matter is whether we’re willing to lie in the hands of the Lord. Some already lie in the hand of the Lord but some choose to depart from His hand. “My sheep know My voice and they hear My voice” 

If we are the sheep of the Lord but don’t hear His voice and follow others instead, then it’s not that the Lord is unable to protect us. It’s that we are unwilling to be in His hand. 

“O Jerusalem! I’m like a mother hen who hides a brood under your wings. It’s just that you’re unwilling.” The entire Jerusalem was hence destroyed. They were unable to see the judgement of the future but Jesus did. It’s not that they hadn’t heard, they heard but were unwilling. 

Today, do we really not understand the word or haven’t heard it? We have heard and we understand. Perhaps we don’t have a deep understanding but we do understand on a basic level. 

Question is: are we willing? Are we willing to adjust our footsteps to follow God? So it’s not that the Lord can’t protect us but we are unwilling to be protected by Him.
