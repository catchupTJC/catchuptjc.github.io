The previous sermon discussed the way Jesus proclaimed Himself to the first church Ephesus. This sermon will continue to discuss the way Jesus proclaimed Himself to the second church Smyrna.

2. Smyrna “the First and the Last, who was dead, and came to life”  
Rev 2:8  
^no one can make such a proclamation except YHWH. Therefore in Isa 44:6, the Lord says, “I am the First and the Last. Besides Me there is no God.” When the Lord Jesus utters the same claim, He is saying that He is YHWH. Jesus proclaims He is the first and the last. This also tells us He’s the beginning of history and also at the end of history. 

Col 1:15  
Paul tells us here that the Lord Jesus it the firstborn over all creation. He is before all things. In other words, before the history of the world, the Lord Jesus was begotten of God. Therefore we say He is the beginning of history. What follows is the creation of heaven and earth. 

What was the purpose of Him being the firstborn? To deliver mankind into eternity. 

Eph 1:4-5  
Paul speaks of two important points here:  
1. He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world  
2. He has predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ 

This is the reason why Jesus is the firstborn. In fact, He was the firstborn BEFORE the foundation of the world. This shows God knew mankind would fall even before they did. God knew Man would lose their status as the son of God and be judged for their sin. But because God loved the world, God already predetermined that Jesus would come and deliver us. Therefore even before the foundation of the world, Jesus was already the firstborn to deliver us unto eternal life. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him will have eternal life 

A question to ponder on: if God didn’t create mankind, would there be a need for Jesus to be the firstborn?  
No. There would be no such titles as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Therefore we believe in the title of the one true God rather than trinity. Because right from the beginning, God is one. It’s because God wanted to create Man and foreknew Man would sin, and predestined Jesus to deliver us, we have Jesus as the firstborn. We hence later see the work of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This doesn’t show God was originally trinity. Therefore this passage shows us clearly God is one from the beginning. 

We also see a beginning of history. It has a beginning and it’ll come to a conclusion. Jesus forms the beginning of history. The purpose of history itself is for Jesus to come into the world to deliver mankind. The end of history will come when Jesus comes again to judge the world. That’s why Jesus addresses Himself as the First and the Last. 

Matt 24:34-37  
Many people reckon that history has no beginning and no end, and therefore reckon there’s no purpose in history itself. History is just repeating itself! Heaven and earth will last forever. One generation comes and goes. But the Lord Jesus tells us very clearly that He’s the First and the Last. This doesn’t just tell us He’s God. It also tells us He’s the beginning and end of history. Many don’t believe but Jesus tells us, “Assuredly I say to you, heaven and earth will pass away but My words will by no means pass away. What day and hour no one knows. But when that day comes, those who believe will be delivered and those that don’t will be judged.” Just like in the days of Noah. Noah obeyed to construct and enter the ark. Not just on his own but his whole family of 8 too. Not that he didn’t want to bring his extended family but they didn’t believe. 

Some people think Noah’s ark is just a fable; a story Christians made up. But the Lord Jesus testifies that this is truth. “As the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.” At that time few believed, only 8. Today the True Jesus Church consists of such a small population relative to the rest of the world. “You’re saying all the other people won’t be saved? God is love. He won’t just deliver members of the True Jesus Church!” Sometimes even our own members are embarrassed to say this, because we know we’re a minority amongst the Christian population. Although Jesus said few will be saved, we wonder: really so few?

But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man. How many were saved during Noah’s time? We would never imagine only 8 were saved. How can God only deliver so few?? It’s not that God didn't want to deliver more people. God wants to deliver all willing to believe and repent. But how many were willing and repented? They saw the ark. The heard and saw for themselves. Noah cried out to them to enter the ark. Even towards the end God performed the miracle of all the animals obediently being led to the ark. They saw for themselves God’s personal guidance. Everyone could see for themselves the miracle before their eyes! Even these animals needed the voice of the Lord to enter the ark. Why were men so hard hearted to the end? This was the final opportunity to give them, but they refused to believe. Do you then blame God for being cruel and hard hearted? God had borne with them and given them ample opportunities, and ample evidence the flood is coming!

Just like today. Not just the Bible tells us. Our Lord Jesus also gives us the Holy Spirit as a testimony. Therefore we ought to believe. Let us be prepared! v44 Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Jesus tells us again and again: when He comes again will be the final judgement, and then the end. 

We know that our Lord is a Lord of history. He started history. He’ll end it as well. And His purpose is to deliver those who believe and bring them into everlasting life. When we understand the Lord is the Lord of history, when there’re tribulations that happen in the course of history, we shouldn’t be alarmed or be in disbelief. 

If we take a look, we see there’re some very dark places of history. The devil is ruling. Those who believe in God are killed. It seems like God isn’t there. There seems to be no hope. A darkness in history. But only a brief moment! Darkness cannot control history. Our Lord Jesus is the true master of history. Therefore He addresses Himself as the First and the Last. Hence we have no fear in changes and hardships that take place. What’s more important is not to be carried by the tide of history. We know history is moving towards a particular direction; it points to Christ. History is waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus to end history. At that time He comes to lead us to everlasting life. The question is: will we be able to enter into everlasting life on the last day? Ponder about this. If this is just a story, we can just laugh about this. But if it’s a true story, then consider His words: Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away

Those who believe, quickly make preparations. Truly repent. Listen to the Lord and follow Him. Then when history ends, we’ll definitely enter into His kingdom. 

The phrase “I am the First and the Last” also means God knows all history and what will happen in the future. All things are not under control of the evil one but God’s. Because the Lord knows how things have happened in the past and evolve in the future. He is the true master of history. He not only controls tomorrow, He controls everything - tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the future, up to the last day. This is why we can be rest assured. We don’t know what can happen tomorrow or in the future, but the Lord does. Therefore we can be rest assured and entrust our future in the hands of God. Because ultimate victory will be in the hands of our Lord. 

It may seem like the church is facing many obstacles; it may seem like the devil is in victory. We can see how difficult it is to be a good Christian to preach the gospel. We see Christians leave the faith and have fallen. All these make us disappointed. But let’s not just look at the present, let’s look at the end. 

Some people ask: why does God allow the devil to continue attacking us? Why does God allow so much hardship to happen in this world and on the church?  
Such people can only see the present but not the future. But God fearing Christians won’t ask these questions. They suffer and some are even martyred. Why don’t they murmur against God? Is it because they don’t think? They are wise people. They have thought through things carefully. They truly understand what the final end will be like, and who controls the end - the Lord Jesus. 

A saying: you would rather suffer along the path to victory then enjoy yourself along the path to destruction  
宁愿在最终必胜的道上受苦，也不愿意在最终必败的道上享乐

Jesus tells us that He is the beginning and the end. From the beginning to the end, He controls everything. Therefore whenever we are suffering, let us look towards Lord Jesus who is the First and the Last. If we can see the end, we would have no fear. 

Have you seen how a renowned painter paints? He draws one stroke here one stroke there. Looks like anyhow one. You think: even my child can draw better! Is he really a renowned painter? It is precisely because he is a renowned painter that he knows the purpose of every stroke. Only when he’s finished can we see how beautiful the end picture is. But we don’t need to wait to the end to see this beautiful picture. Jesus has already presented the completed and perfect Jerusalem in Revelation. He lets us see the final picture of victory. He lets us see the end of the evil one. He also lets us see the end of those who go against the faith/turned apostate. 

Revelation is hence a very important book. We shouldn’t say “ah it’s too deep. Skip this book.” Some people say: you’re so proud! You’re so young and you want to read Revelation? Skip Revelation and read Mark!” But what does the beginning of Rev say?

Rev 1:3  
“Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.”  
Of course in order to keep these words, we must know them. And to know, we need to read. Therefore we ought to read this book, because the day is near. Of course there’re many things we don’t understand here. 

At least have an impression of what’s happening. Then what we see will correlate with what we read. If we don’t read, we have no such impression and have no idea how it links with history!

Therefore the book of Revelation tells us that we must read. Even if we don’t understand, read first. Because the Lord Jesus has presented this as a vision to be imprinted in our minds so that we have an impression. 

“Who was dead and came to life”  
“Who was dead” means He once came into the world to bear our sins and died. “Came to life” means that He overcame death; He resurrected. 

This phrase tells us that His resurrection proves that He is the Lord of life. Those who believe in Him will also resurrect with Him. This proclamation was the greatest source of comfort to the church of Smyrna who was facing persecution and whose members were being killed. 

Many scholars believe the bishop of Smyrna was Polycarp, a disciple of John. In 155AD, he was burnt to death in Smyrna. When he was on the way to his execution, the officer in charge advised him, “Just proclaim Caesar is lord. Make an offering to the image of Caesar and you’ll be spared.” He refused. When he arrived at the execution place, the officer in charge also said likewise, “Just curse the Lord Jesus and you’ll be spared from death.”  
“86 years I’ve served the Lord. He has never disappointed me. How can I blaspheme the name of the Lord Jesus so that I live?”  
“Do you know you’ll be burnt to death for this?”  
“I do. But do you know that the fire you burn me with will last for at most an hour. But the fire that’ll burn in the day of judgement will be forever!”  
He was burnt to death. But he left behind beautiful footsteps and a beautiful testimony for us. 

The reason Smyrna was able to hold on in the face of persecution was not just due to their good shepherd who held on to the end, also when they read the letter to them, how God addressed Himself as the one who was dead and came to life, brought great comfort to them. At most, they’d die due to the tribulation. The most the devil can do is to persecute us to die. “But we have the Lord who came back to life. We will die and come back to life! We will enjoy glory with Him!”

So Peter encourages us when we undergo the trial of fire, do not fear. Because our Lord has already told us that we must undergo tribulations. He also warns us that those who deny Him will be denied by Him before our Father in Heaven. 

When we’re being tried in our faith, let us courageously acknowledge our Lord. It’s easy to deny Him. But we’ll have to bear with the consequences of eternal sufferings. 

Don’t fear him who can kill the body but not the soul. Fear him who can kill both the body and soul. 

Let us hence heed the words of Jesus and make preparations. Not just to pray for the Holy Spirit but also through the help of the Holy Spirit, establish a strong faith so we can face all temptations and tribulations.
