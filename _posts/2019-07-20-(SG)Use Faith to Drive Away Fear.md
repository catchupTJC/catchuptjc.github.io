Psa 56 is a Micheal of David when the Philistines captured him in Gath. It is set to “The Silent Dove in Distant Lands” - he was truly alone. 

The psalmist used two psalms (34 and 56)  to describe his feelings because this incident had left a great impact on him. If not for God who delivered him, he would’ve lost his life. 

Both Psa 34 and 56 shows how David relied on the true God. This incident is recorded in 1 Sam 21:10-15.

Structure of Psa 56:  
v1-2 David called out to God and only in God could he rely on. The situation was really dangerous and precarious. 

v3-4 is a turning point which occurred because he decided to entrust all to God. 

v5-7 talks about how David’s enemies responded.

v8-11 talks about how David was able to continue relying on God despite being in this situation. 

v12-13 is how David is going to praise the Lord. 

Zooming in:  
v1-2 clearly talks about the fear of the psalmist as he faces this situation. His enemies have surrounded him. 

Who is our true enemy? Ourselves. If you’re able to overcome your fear then you’ll be victorious. Before sitting for a test, you must first overcome the fear in your heart. Why do we allow fear to rob us of a heart of trust in God? Why not rely on God to cast out fear instead?

We may face situations like David in life. Fear oppresses us so greatly, we can’t bear it. It could be financial difficulties, the fear others inject into you, the fear of the unknown future. Regardless, fear brings great stress and oppression. How should we overcome it?

Psa 56:3-4  
v3 Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.  
David repeats trusting God 6 times in this psalm.

v4 In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?  
Some religions explain fear as an illusion. Once you rid yourself of these illusions, then there’ll have no fear. But it is reality that brings you fear. It’s not because you’ve not seen what’s reality. 

How should we manage the fear in our hearts? Trust in God. 

How was David able to trust in God, and on what basis did he trust in God?

Trusting God is having absolute/100% faith in Him. Only then will you rely on Him. 

What does it mean to rely? It is having a faith with a foundation. 

v4 In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?

David repeats (I will praise His word) in v10. His word is truth and we can put 100% trust in it because the truth will always be unchanging. 

Psa 119:130  
The entrance of Your words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple.

The word of God is like a bright light. In calamities and precarious situations, it’s like we’re in darkness. 

In darkness, you can’t grope your way to an entrance. But the word of God is like a bright light that’s able to illuminate the way forward for us to find an exit. 

The word of God is the only standard. It is the only thing that allows us to build up and establish our own faith. 

If both our minds and hearts are filled with the word of God, will there be space for fear the work? Of course not! Fear will be cast out!

Don’t let fear ruin our lives. Quickly learn the example the psalmist has left us. 

Psa 56:11  
“In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?”  
When we look at God directly, fear will flee from us. 

Often, we are the cause of our own fears. It could be because we look down on ourselves and imagine how others look at us. It could be because we don’t trust others. 

What about our relationship with God? How do we look at God? How does God look at us? 

True faith allows us to get out of the loop of fear. If we’re fearful because we’re overly concerned about the circumstances we’re in, it’ll be difficult to set our eyes on God. 

Rom 8:31  
“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?”  
Circumstances can cause us to fear so much, we’re unable to continue in our faith and trust in God. We feel like the more we pray, the worse our situation becomes. But the Bible tells us to set our eyes on God. 

John 14:26-27  
v26 “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will  send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. v27 Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”

The peace God gives us isn’t earthly. It’s inner peace. 

When we look unto God, fear will leave us and peace enters into our hearts. He also gives us the precious Holy Spirit. 

Rom 8:26-27  
v26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  
v27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

The Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. How amazing is the Holy Spirit!

In the weakest points of our lives, kneel down and pray. “He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.”

Perhaps we don’t get a response after praying. But through the Holy Spirit in prayer, drive away the fear. The problem may not go away but because the Holy Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God, the more we pray, the more we’d be able to understand His will. The more we comprehend His will, the more we’ll be able to rejoice. This enables us to receive peace in our hearts. 

When we’re willing to set our eyes on God, look at Him and rely on Him, fear will leave. 

The psalmist of Psa 56 faced great tribulation. But he left the example of using faith to cast out fear for us. He set his eyes on and put his trust in God. 

1 John 5:4  
For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world— our faith.

Use faith to drive fear away.
