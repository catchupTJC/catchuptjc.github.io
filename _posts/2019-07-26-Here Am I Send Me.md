Isa 6:8
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?”
Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.”

If this question was posed to you today, how would you respond/answer? Would you be like how children typically reply their parents? “I’m very busy now don’t trouble me. Go find brother or sister.” Or “I’ll help you later I’m busy now!” Or “Go google on your own!”

Will we answer the Lord like this when He asks whom He should send? “I’m busy now, why you ask me?” “You gave me this job that makes me so busy. I have no time!” “If you really want to send someone, send someone else! Others have more free time than me!”

All of us would probably have heard this question before. How would we respond? “There’s other work I can do. I don’t have to do full time work.” This question is usually used as an encouragement to take up full time ministry. 

The youngest preacher in Singapore is already 42. In just 10 years time, we’ll be lacking workers. We shouldn’t wait till 10 years later to think about this problem. Some of us may be thinking that there’re many years left, don’t need to worry. But it’s been 11 years since the youngest preacher attended the theological seminar. Will anyone take on the baton?

The Lord calls out, “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?”

When the Lord says this, He didn’t compel anyone. He phrases it as a QUESTION. A person who carries this work out must hence have a willing heart. If you’re reluctant, it’ll be very difficult to carry this work out. Some people enter the ministry due to their parents. Consequently, they don’t do the work with much zeal. 

Here we see one man who replies. In actuality, there were no other human beings; only angels. God wasn’t asking the angels. There was only one human being in that setting but God still asked, “Who will go for Us?”

Before this, Isaiah was a prophet who worked for God. When God asked, his response was one that was very affirmative. “Here am I! Send me.”

Let us consider how he answered. Would we be able to reply in like manner? 

The work of full time ministry is not suited for everyone. People who don’t have the heart to do this work hence shouldn’t be FORCED. 

But have we thought about whether God wants us to do this work? The speaker has asked some youths and they’ve responded with a “no” “not me lah”. The speaker then says, “But have you prayed about it? How do you know you’re not suited?” Is it the case where God has told you you’re not suited or have you determined on your own that you’re not suited?

Some brothers said that they wanted to be preachers when they were 14-16 years old. We may think that since they’re so young, their endeavour isn’t genuine. But how do you know? The speaker had the thought of being a preacher since he was 15 years old. After he completed his O levels, people asked him what he wanted to do and he said it didn’t matter because he wanted to be a preacher. People may think this is just a child’s wish but even in his 20s, he wanted to be a preacher. When he 29, he dedicated himself to the full time ministry. He’s not trying to say he’s very talented but he has a willing heart to offer to the Lord which God was willing to accept. 

Some of us might have this moving in our hearts when we’re younger. Don’t just treat this as a childish thought. Perhaps that’s God’s calling to you. Think about Samuel who was called at an evil younger age. 

It’s a pity that when the speaker asked the young brothers again, they say they no longer have the want to be a preacher. The speaker doesn’t know if their endeavour was just a childish thought or they had come to this conclusion after prayer. 

We should think about this. We shouldn’t just say “we don’t want” because how do you know God doesn’t want you?

In Myanmar, the speaker worked with two adorable preachers (who’re strongly against KPOP lol). One of them is the most recent preacher to take up this role. During service, he bore testimony of how he became a preacher. The speaker wondered how he was able to endure that period. 
A person had encouraged him to be a preacher. He said he didn’t want because he wanted to do teaching. He was already doing teaching work but he wanted to attain proper certification. He was diligent studying to get his certification. One day, there was something wrong with his eyelids. Before his exam, he realised he couldn’t open his eyelids. He could only vaguely sense some light. He went to many hospitals in Korea but no one could help him. It was then he remembered the thought of coming out to become a preacher. He then went to the theological college. He still had the eyelid problem when he was there. To read and study, he has to use his fingers to open his eye lids alamak
He had this condition for 2 years but persisted in remaining in the theological course. One day during a typical service, he was seated listening to the word. Suddenly he felt that his eyelids felt different. From that point forth, his eyes recovered! He’s fully recovered now and you’d never be able to tell he had this condition before. 

This brother didn’t want to be a preacher. But did he know whether God wanted him to be a preacher?

Not everyone needs to be a full time worker/preacher. But how are you so sure it’s not you? Let us put in the effort to put this matter in prayer. (If not maybe our eyes will have problem lol)

Sometimes it may be the case: It’s not that I don’t want. It’s that I’m not suited. 

Do you think Isaiah was suitable? He was a man of unclean lips (Isa 6:5). He wasn’t good enough but God still wanted to use him. This is a very real and genuine emotion that can’t just be brushed aside. Isaiah felt it too. But he voiced it out, and God cleansed him (Isa 6:6-7).
If you feel you’re not qualified in a certain manner, but if you have the heart to do His work and respond to God’s calling, and are willing to voice this out to God, God will purge us of this sin so we become suitable for this work. The fundamental question is whether we have the heart to carry this work out. 

Brothers and sisters, do you have the heart to carry this work out?

By the ratio of preachers to church, Singapore seems to have an adequate number of preachers. In South Korea, there’re 32-33 churches while there’re 22 preachers.

But if we look at it from another angle, we have 5 preachers but what extent is the church developing at? If the church had more preachers, would the church be further developed?

Does the lack of youths who want to commit themselves to full time work reflect the existence of a problem in church? Could it be that our youths don’t have a heart to serve in church? Or could it be that they have set a limit to their service to God and none of them want to step out of their boundary to take up full time work?

In Taiwan, a large batch of preachers are about to retire. Will there be enough preachers to take their place? We need to pray for this matter because it concerns a very important work in church. 

Even though God doesn’t demand everyone of us to take up full time work, God has called each and everyone of us. 

2 Cor 5:20
We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God we’re pleasing through us. Paul wasn’t talking about himself. He used “WE are ambassadors for Christ”. This means the Corinth church and us. Ambassadors represent a country in another country. You have been sent by your own country to another country. So even though not every member has been called to do full time ministry, God has called out to each and everyone of us to do His work. What work? Reconciling people to God (2 Cor 5:19). We have been committed the word of reconciliation; to reconcile the world to God. We all have this commission/responsibility, even if we’re all not in this full time ministry. 

Reconciling people to God means we have to warn others. Exhort others. Even judge others. This is the work we have as ambassadors. 

Today when we see any brother or sister that’s weak, encourage him/her. Don’t wait for a preacher to do it. The preacher has a duty to do so. But you are his/her friend. When he/she tells you her problem, it is your duty to encourage him/her. When he/she tells you that they’re at the edge, wouldn’t you want to do something lest they reach the point where you have to judge them - a really sad thing. 

If a brother/sister confides in you with their problem, take the opportunity to exhort them. 

One of the most effective means of doing this is to come to church for service. The authors of Hebrews encourages this: don’t forsake the assembling of ourselves together (Heb 10:25). Gathering for service is a very good means to carry out this work. But many people don’t want to come for service. Perhaps we can’t say that; 60% of our total membership come for Sabbath afternoon service. But out of this number, how many % will stay back after service? Once service ends, all the cars have to shift. Maybe 30-40% leave immediately. The rest? After 30min, most leave. After an hour, it’s empty. Arguably, it’s relatively better than some other churches where the lights are all off immediately after service. 

Gathering in service is very effective. After the service, we can gather and encourage one another. Sadly many members leave quickly. They attend the service but don’t receive the full benefits of coming to church. “Don’t forsake the assembling of ourselves”. Don’t stop coming together for service. If you do this, we can encourage one another. 

We may find service dry and tasteless. We just want to rush home. Perhaps we should spend a little more time in church after service. We are ambassadors of Christ. Our duty is to encourage one another. 

The Singapore church is considered to be cold. The Korean preacher told this to the speaker. Several people have made such a comment too. 
In Singapore, we are very busy with our own family matters. The speaker’s neighbours had no idea his mother was hospitalised for 3 months until she passed away. Such is the Singapore society now. 

Today, only a wall separates us from our neighbours (cf. fields of empty land in the past). Yet we’re even more distant. 

Today visitors comment Singapore church feel cold. Let’s reflect on this. We’re ambassadors. Do we smile at one another? Or do we just have a sour face?

Some people think: this person only cares about me out of responsibility.
The speaker thinks: huh isn’t it good the person cares for you at least?

Often, we only care for someone when they’re in trouble/sick. But on a normal basis, we don’t. This is a thinking point for us; to improve and reflect on.

Some churches have adopted good habits. After service, members in Myanmar take the initiative to shake hands. The speaker used to think it was rather troublesome but after a while, he thinks it’s quite a good idea to shake each others’ hands and interact with each other. 

We have to play our part as ambassadors. If we’re not familiar how to carry this role out well, we need to think further how we can truly be an ambassador, since we have been sent. 

We’re also not only ambassadors in church. As ambassadors, we also have to preach and warn unbelievers. We have to lead outsiders into the church that they may be reconciled to God. Have we don’t our part today?

Today, most of us would have preached to one person or another. But do we do it diligently or only when the opportunity presents itself?

Let us be diligent in doing this work, because there’re so many Christians preaching false gospels outside! There is poison in what they say. 

In Myanmar, there was a someone who preached that Sabbath didn’t need to be kept because Jesus fulfilled the law. The speaker asked her to explain what the fulfilment of the law means. She said, “We just need to believe in Jesus. We don’t need to rely on the law anymore.”
“Then how do you know you can’t worship idols?”
She didn’t answer. Because this is only made known from the 10 commandments. 
“Where in the Bible says we cannot worship idols?”
She didn’t dare to answer. 
The speaker said they could discuss further next time. You still need to give others a chance. 

Some Christians outside truly say strange things. They say we don’t need to keep the Sabbath because Jesus has fulfilled the law and yet also believe we can’t worship idols which is also in the law.

The speaker tries to be more tactful now when preaching. He used to say we are the one true church on the get go. But now he talks about our 5 basic doctrines first. He says, “You may not believe this now but perhaps you can take the time to study with us.” He is very direct in saying we are the one true church. 

Some people only want to be baptised because of marriage. In Myanmar, there is the custom where the female MUST be baptised in the church of the husband. They expect True Jesus Church to baptise the woman. But the speaker was very forthcoming “If you don’t believe we’re the true church, I won’t baptise you.” He believes in making things clear instead of beating around the bush. 

Another church believes in God the mother; that God is female. But how does this impact salvation? Furthermore, it’s so clear that God is our Father in heaven. 

We hence need to preach the true gospel diligently. They preach really warped teachings, but we still need to try. When people say strange teachings, we’d then know how to reply them, and we’d be able to bring the gospel to more people. 

Often, preaching the gospel is easy. The speaker was recently hospitalised. There was an uncle sleeping opposite him and he could tell he was a Christian. The speaker didn’t do anything at first and just watched his own videos. But this uncle was listening to hymns and sermons. The speaker thought  “Wah outsider doing all this and I’m here watching my videos.” So he stopped watching his videos.

The speaker decided to walk up to the uncle’s bed and strike up a conversation. The uncle was very willing to share his life story. Subsequently the speaker shared he was a preacher in True Jesus Church. But he was based in Myanmar now so he would contact him when he was back in Singapore. He invited him for service tomorrow but the uncle is in hospital now. 

It’s easy when you’re first willing to talk to others. Especially when you see they’re reading the Bible on their own; you can tell they’re Christian. Being an ambassador is not a difficult thing. We have to be willing to carry out this work so that when God calls out to us we can say, “Here am I! Send me.”
