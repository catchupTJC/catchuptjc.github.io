Everyone of us have our own families. From young, our parents brought us up. Or perhaps you have established your own new family. The Bible places special emphasis on families. In Genesis, God created Adam, then Eve, and placed them in the Garden of Eden to establish a family. The Bible also gives several illustrations of various families - some are model families, some are corrupt families. Some are blessed by God. 

There’re many precious teachings in the Bible. In our life of faith, as we study the Bible, we’ll discover the teachings found in the Bible are good. There’re 66 books in the Bible, of which 2 books use the name of a woman. One would be Esther. In Esther, there is no term ‘God’. Yet we read of the deliverance and help of God, and His abidance. Second is Ruth. The book describes the family and the changes that took place. This book is beautiful; it depicts the changes the family went through. From the time of departure to return; from the time they were lost to the time they were saved. Even though we don’t read the term ‘love’ in Ruth, the book is full of love. It encompasses the love between God and Man, and Man and Man. Today as we live in this world, we have to place emphasis on our families; show concern and build it up. 

In Judges, many families were corrupted, immoral and fought with each other. They were broken. But the family in the book of Ruth was sacred, blessed and feared the Lord. The book of Ruth also depicts the weaknesses of Man; it also shows the preservation and guidance of the Lord. It talks about the family of Elimelech who was husband to Naomi. His sons took wives from Moab. Naomi’s husband and 2 sons died. This book also talks about the love between mother and daughter in law. It then talks about their return to Bethlehem and Ruth establishing her family. This illustrates the deliverance of the Lord, as David also came from her. 

The book of Ruth first tells us that while we’re on earth, our house is temporary. 
Ruth 1:1
We are just sojourners on this earth. All families should adopt this mindset. Abraham left Ur and went to the place God directed him to. He often shifted his tent and when he did so, he’d erect an altar to worship the Lord. Abraham understood man on earth are sojourners. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the people of Israel all went down to Egypt. But all departed from there. Egypt depicts the world. There’re many countries in this world. Due to many factors, some have no choice but to emigrate. But no matter where you move to, know you are but a sojourner. 

We have limited time while we’re living in this world. Because people want a higher quality of life, they move to a better place for the sake of their children/future generations. Some move to US, Canada, Europe, Switzerland.

During WW2, Germany had taken Europe into captivity. Many people sent their families to Argentina where there were no wars. But after some times, some people felt it wasn’t good and so went to South Africa. They thought it was a beautiful place. They did not expect that the houses there are often robbed. 

The speaker went to South Africa in January. An exco member shared with him that a member was shot 9 times but survived. The speaker asked, “Does this brother still want to stay in this place?” “Yes, because he can earn a lot of money here.” “Even if you want to earn money here, it’s important to establish your faith and the church.”

They wanted to sell one of the churches in Johannesburg. But they were encouraged to be zealous. Thank God now many people attend the church. 

A professor in the Taiwan university looked at the map to ascertain where was the best place to stay. He determined that Forkland(?) was the best. There was a war between Argentina and ?. Truly what man plans cannot take into account what heaven has in store. So he moved back to Taiwan.

Know you’re a sojourner. You’re citizens of a heavenly kingdom. You dwell in a place for a short time. Whether on earth or sea, where the Lord is, that’s where heaven is. It’s most important for the Lord to be with you wherever you dwell.

Heb 11:13
A Christian has 3 homes:
1. On earth
2. House of God 
3. The better home in heaven
As pilgrims on earth, our homes are in heaven. Why are the hakkas called hakkas? Because they’re just drifting along in this world; they’re sojourners. Historians studied that Hakkas originally dwelled in China but due to war, they shifted to the south. Due to other factors, some moved to Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia. Hakkas are very special. Due to environmental factors, they’re very diligent and are able to suffer, because they know they’re but sojourners in this life. We’re just like a tent. We’re just staying here for a short period of time.

Ruth 1:3
This family faced hardships. It goes through sufferings. The meaning of the name Elimelech is ‘my Lord my God’. Naomi means ‘sweetness’. They had faith initially and they were dwelling in Bethlehem. So many changes took place unexpectedly. We always hope for peace in our families but as we dwell on earth, we’d definitely face suffering. Facing death is inevitable. Naomi didn’t expect to lose her husband and two sons. She went out full and returned empty. She went out full of hope and returned hopeless. She survived her husband and two sons. Without a husband, she doesn’t have a reliance. Without sons, she was without hope. 

Ruth 1:21
At least Naomi returned from Moab to Bethlehem, with one daughter in law Ruth returning to her. 

Our families will go through many changes. Each household will have their own story to tell. The first miracle the Lord Jesus performed in this world happened in the family of a newlywed. The water turned to wine. Not to encourage us to drink alcohol but to tell us that in the bland and simple water we have, the grace God has given us is ? (speaker spoke over the interpreter). 

Psa 34:8
“Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.”

We all hope we can go out empty and return full. But the opposite was true for Naomi. Nonetheless in times of difficulties, she relied on God. 

When we meet with similar hardships, rely on God. Acknowledge Him in all your ways and He will help you. If you rely on God as if you’re a tree planted along the rivers, you’ll be able to be nourished and bear fruit. 

Naomi had no one to rely on. No husband. No sons. Only God was her reliance. 

If you depart from God and come to a dead end, you must recall God has to be your starting point. We who have faith today must believe God is our reliance. 

Psa 68 tells us God is the reliance of the widows. He’s the Father to the orphans. 

Hence when the Lord Jesus turned water into wine and the wine was used up, it’s like us running into problems. It’s inevitable a family meets problems. 

When a believer was leading a service, his accent was very strong so the believers couldn’t make out what he was saying. He was talking about turning water into wine (水变酒) but they heard it as anyhow walking (随便走). At the end he meant to say “May God bless and help you” (愿神赐福你和帮助你) but they heard “May God bully you and bind you up” (愿神欺负你和绑住你) lol
In times of tribulations, we have to think of this. Don’t ever depart from God in our life of faith. Return and go back to Him. 

Ruth 1:16-17
These were Ruth’s heartfelt words to Naomi. Both Naomi and Ruth displayed their faith. 

Ruth 2:12
A righteous family will be given a full reward. 

Noah’s family didn’t follow the tide and continued walking with the Lord. Same for Abraham’s family. Cornelius’ family too; he feared the Lord, prayed always, did good, helped people, was full of love. His prayer and alms became a memorial towards God. A family of faith will be able to experience God’s blessing. 

Gen 26:25
Isaac did 3 things:
1. Build an altar. His faith in God.
2. Pitched his tent.
3. Dig a well. His life in society; his work.

Notice he built an altar first. Our faith must be placed right at the front. 

What did the Philistines see from this? That the Lord was with him. Then wherever we walk, the Lord will be with us. Because we draw near to God, and He draws near to us. 

Boaz was a man who fears the Lord and keeps his word too. He takes responsibility. 

When Naomi’s husband and sons died, Ruth showed her love. 

Even in times of trouble, Naomi blessed Ruth to have a new family. She showed her concern and love. 

In their dialogue, we can see that Naomi and Ruth loved each other. We see true love. 

When couples are in love, they talk about how they’d love each other even when the stones erode away and the seas run dry. But due to circumstances, they change. 

True love has forbearance. Love suffers long. All this is seen in the book of Ruth. 

Today we have to learn from these teachings. Pursue after this love so that our families are able to show concern and understand each other. This love will be found amongst Man. Love others. If you don’t know how to love those in your household, all is in vain. 

We need to know what love is about and to have love in this family. Have God’s love and His abidance for this family to be blessed. 

There’re many blessings in the book of Ruth; 8 in total. Blessings between mother and daughter in law. Between master and servants. Between rich man towards a slave girl. From a person who has grace to (interpreter got cut off again). Elders blessed Boaz and Ruth. Women who blessed Ruth. 

Ruth 4:11-12, 14
A blessed family is one that has God’s blessing. 

Psa 128:1-6 can also be put in the book of Ruth. It talks about how those who fear the Lord will be blessed. He’ll see the children’s children (i.e. faith is passed down from generation to generation; there’re godly offspring). 

Psa 115:13-15
When a family is blessed, both great and small will be blessed. A family may meet with difficulties but when they rely on God, they’re able to display understanding and love to one another. They’ll ultimately be blessed. 

In the recent Holy Spirit times, there’s an article about how knowing the grace of God grants a fragrant life. In the family, there’s a mother and daughter in law. After some time, the husband died. They came to believe because the husband fell sick. She had to bring to the child on her own. The child fell sick too. She prayed for him. After the child grew up and had his own family, she felt so tired. Turns out she had cancer. She said if she didn’t have Jesus, she wouldn’t know how she could have continued walking. She was a very strong woman. She didn’t shed tears for no reason, though she wept in her heart. Later she was diagnosed with cancer again, she had 3 cancerous tumours. She was in a lot of suffering but the grace of the Lord was sufficient. If the Lord wants her to live, she’d live. If the Lord wants her to go, she’d go. It’s been more than 10 years and she’s taste the grace of the Lord. She now has grandchildren. She also has a good relationship with her in laws. Her family is a good testimony. 

Like Naomi who became Marah but is now returning to sweetness. 

We believe God abides us forever.
