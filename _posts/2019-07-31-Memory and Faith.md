Luke 22:60-62
The Lord Jesus turned and looked at Peter, causing memories in Peter to be evoked. It was this memory that caused Peter to weep bitterly. 

Memories are good things that humans have. Memories can influence many things in our lives, including our lifestyle. Good memories allows us to live our lives with strength. Good memories help us to receive and treasure more things. As for bad memories, the Bible exhorts us to forget what is behind 

The speaker (preacher from Malaysia) would like to share the memories he has of Singapore. From the 70-90s, Singapore and Malaysia church were under the same GA. A special event brought together members in Singapore and Malaysia - the student theological seminar. The speaker was part of the 80s batch. Back then, it took him 14h to travel to Singapore because there wasn’t a highway. 

He grew up in church so he attended the Bible camps since young. Every Bible camp they would pray very hard and would lose their voices. It lasted 28 days! Whenever he came to Singapore for theolo, he’d pray from day 1 to day 28 but still didn’t receive. He didn’t receive in his first and second year. In his third year, he made a foolish prayer. He told Jesus, “This is my last year to be in Singapore. If you don’t give me the Holy Spirit, I won’t go back.” A truly foolish prayer but he was indeed foolish then. 4-5 of his buddies prayed together during the Spiritual Meeting at Klang. But he didn’t pray with much effort because he his heart wanted to receive the Holy Spirit in Singapore. But in the second day, he received the Holy Spirit in Klang church lol. (He doesn’t know if that’s why he ended up marrying a sister in Klang church.) So on the third day, he came to Singapore with the Holy Spirit. 

In that particular year for some unknown reason, the participants were naughtier. A lot of things happened. This grieved an elder from Taiwan. It was the second week and the Taiwan Elder rebuked then. Many students were late for prayer. The Elder rebuked them for up to two days. 

The speaker would like to share a very important memory of his. It was a miracle. 

After the elder scolded them, the prayer was very miraculous. It was in the Old TK Church. The prayer ate into dinner time. Everyone was praying. He had already received the Holy Spirit but that particular prayer session has put faith in a certain position to this day. He sang spiritually! It’s never happened again to him. In that prayer, many miraculous things happened. More than 40 people received the Holy Spirit. He still remembers the scene. When the prayer ended the elder said, “Don’t move. Those who are sure you spoke in tongues, stand up.” Even the children of the cooks who helped out who joined in the prayer received. A neighbour of TK who was walking past commented that he heard the sound of flooding in church. He ran over to check it out and found out it was the sound of prayers! For those praying in the hall, they heard the sound of thunder coming in through the door. 

Rev 19:4-6
v4 describes the worship they were making before God. v5 talks about the voice that came from the throne, which represents the church. If the church doesn’t have the Holy Spirit, they wouldn’t be able to comprehend v6 “voice of a great multitude...sound of many waters”. 

The memory the speaker had: he sang in spiritual tongues, more than 40 people received the Holy Spirit, and many people hearing the sound of thunder.

This spiritual experience was to the speaker just like how Peter said, “It is good to be here” on the mount of transfiguration. This single memory has accompanied the speaker’s faith and affirms the presence of the Holy Spirit in the True Jesus Church. That’s why the memory of Singapore has always accompanied his faith. 

Pr Chong shared that over 10 Myanmar participants received the Holy Spirit. He hopes this would signal an improvement in the Myanmar church. The speaker opines it will be so.

In 2005, IA entrusted Sabah to look after the holy work in Philippines. Philippines conducted their first short term theological course. Those in charge had a really difficult time conducting this course because Philippines is a poor country. Once there’re school holidays, parents want their children to work to earn money. Therefore when the church announced that there would be a theological course for 16-17 days, parents weren’t keen to allow their children to attend because they didn’t even know what it was. In the end, 90 children in all of Philippines gathered. There were 3 preachers who helped - the speaker and 2 other preachers from Sabah. In the first prayer day of prayer, more than 80 had not received the Holy Spirit. When the preacher announced for those who didn’t have the Holy Spirit to come forward, it seemed like almost everyone came forward. In the prayer on the first day, the speaker felt like the feeling was very different. A number of people started speaking in tongues! But because it was the first prayer, they didn’t confirm. On the second day, more people spoke in tongues. On the third day, even more people spoke in tongues! When the bell rang, it was like the prayer was hard to stop! It gradually became softer. The sound of tongues diminished like an engine rumbling. In that year, more than 70 received the Holy Spirit. Only 10 or so had not received. The 3 preachers had this feeling: Jesus truly had mercy on the Philippine members; it would definitely help the church. 

These experiences of receiving the Holy Spirit or being filled brought much edification to the church and members. 2005 is a year the speaker will never forget. 

They came to the realisation that if the Lord Jesus wants to be in their midst, what extent of power they can feel!

Those who received the Holy Spirit in Philippines carried on to do church work. 8 preachers were from two batches of this theolo. 

Apart from children receiving the Holy Spirit, they also encountered with problems in the spiritual realm. As Jesus poured the Holy Spirit down, we also see the work of the devil. 

The speaker would like to share this encouragement to the Myanmar church. The many children who received the Holy Spirit in the recent camp surely shows the Lord Jesus will work with Myanmar church. 

The speaker will now like to talk about another testimony. 
Rev 2:4-5
Preaching the gospel requires love. When we first came to believe in Jesus, we experience the full abundance of the love of our Lord. We should therefore remember how our Lord has loved us. Then with our actions, show our love to God and each other. Singapore Church is now advocating the All 8 movement where the whole family comes to believe. The work of saving souls requires a great amount of love. 

It’s been more than 10 years since the speaker was a resident preacher at Klang church. The sister of the late Dn Thomas Cheh(?). Sis Cheh contracted lung cancer and she was in the terminal stage. Her husband was very superstitious and in the committee of the temple. In her life, he didn’t like it when she went to church. Still she went. When she contracted cancer, it’s common sense that her husband would get angry with her for going. She was the sole believer because her husband didn’t allow her to bring the children. 

And so she contracted cancer at 70, and this is where the testimony begins. A group of people would make their way to her house to pray for her. They all knew her husband disliked them. They went to her house and her husband was there. He sat in a chair in a corner. After saying a few words, they knelt down to pray and the deacon and speaker laid hands on her. When the speaker laid hands, he felt something in front of him. He didn’t know what it was so he was preparing his heart. Turns out it was her husband poking his head and peering at him LOLLOL

When the speaker opened his eyes and met eyes with her husband, he quickly walked off as if nothing had happened HAHA

Sis Cheh went through this for half a year. She had a helper in the house who cared for her for 10 years. In the last few days, the helper stayed in the hospital with her. One night she woke up to go to the toilet. She saw four people in white standing at Sis Cheh’s bed. “Huh so late still got church people visiting her??” She didn’t think too much of it and went back to bed. The next night, she saw four in white again. But this time she noticed two had wings. The two of them lifted Sis Cheh up and that’s when the heart rate went flat. The helper quickly went to find a doctor who proclaimed she had passed. 

During the funeral, the helper related what she witnessed. They told the helper none of the members would dress in all white nor have wings lol

After the funeral, her husband came to church on his own. Elder Cheh’s wife grabbed hold of the speaker and told him to note him. “Check if he means to cause trouble.” Because this seemed out of character. He came every Friday and Saturday. And he would come and leave quickly. One day, they managed to stop him and asked him why he had been coming. He replied:

There’re two reasons I come to church:
1. The doctor told me lung cancer is supposed to be very painful but my wife didn’t have any pain at all. Your Lord Jesus must be very great 
2. I have seen your love 

He got baptised. He brought all the children. The whole family came to Christ. This entire family came to believe because of the persistence of Sis Cheh. When one comes to believe, the whole family can come to believe. 

There was once the speaker went to kachiao Sis Cheh’s husband. After speaking the sermon, he came down and stooped down and peered at him just like he did when they first visited his wife! “Preacher don’t laugh at me!” he exclaimed.

A few years ago, he too passed away from cancer. Because of the persistence of one family member’s faith, grace came upon the rest of the family members.
