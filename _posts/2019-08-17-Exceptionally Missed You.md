-In our lives, we have memories, some  are happy and some sad.
-When a person grows old, memories of the past becomes even more important than the present memories.

-Phil 4:8 There are 8 things that are worth remembering. 
”Finally brothers whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, thing about these things”. 

-When we are persecuted, criticized, slandered, who do we remember ?
1) A person exceptionally missed when faced difficult situations is Joseph 
-Gen 37:3-5 Joseph was hated because he was honest. Because of his sincere words, his honesty and was loved most by his father, this was the beginning of his trials.

-Joseph is someone is exceptionally missed. 
-He faced sufferings because he stood by the truth and righteousness. 
-His brothers wanted to really kill him and you can see how evil his brothers were at that time. 
-Joseph was filial, honest and still was hated by the brothers. 
-In this world today, we have such society who hates the truth, holiness and righteousness. 
-Although Joseph was attacked by his brothers, how was his response?
-Gen 50:19-21 
Why did the brothers only asked forgiveness after leaving the Israel for such a long time and is in the last chapter of Genesis. 
-They thought Joseph did not dare to take revenge because their father, Israel/Jacob was still alive. 
-So they thought Joseph took care of them because of their father.. 
-Here Joseph assured them and asked them not to fear and it was God meant for good to bring it about the many people should be kept alive. He will continue to provide for them and their children.
-Joseph was able to forgive and no longer hate his brothers but instead was able to love and take care of them. 
-Joseph which means multiply was able to multiply in his love and forgiveness. 
-Today what are we multiplying? When spouses argue, when parents & children argue, we multiply in hatred. 
-However for Joseph, amidst in his situation, he is a tree that was able to bear fruits  despite whatever situations that befell upon him. 

2) Another person exceptionally missed is Dorcas in 
Act 9:36-42
-In this society, love grows cold and love today is superficial. ---We missed Dorcas which her name means beautiful sheep. Her life is full of warmth and love. During the winter, she spread her warmth by making tunics and other garments for the poor. 
-She was devoted to good works and led acts of charity until the day she died. She led a good life. That is her value of her life.
-Acts 9:39 When she died, a lot of people gathered around her. It was the widows, the needy and the poor were the ones 
who was weeping for her. 
- These are the community that really needed love and care. Dorcas gave them so much love regardless of their status and poverty. 
-They even bear testimonies for Dorcas showing the tunics and garments that she has made for them. During that time, to make a garment took a lot of time and much effort. Yet because she has great love and care for the widows and poor, she never faltered in her love. 
-In today’s society, whats app and emoji is popular. However this must be followed with actions eg we need to go deeper than sending the whats app message but to really practice ie to really pray for those who are sick, to call for those who needs comfort and really help monetary for the poor.

-Dorcas was missed because she led a life of love and she indeed spread her warmth of love and care for the poor. 

-She led her life of love and God resurrected her for her life was full of meaning to those she cared for.
 
3) A person exceptionally missed is Jonah. 
-In most cases, Jonah is scorned as Jonah ran away from God . However, he was a great worker of God. The book of Jonah was written by prophet Jonah himself. 
-He was actually rebuking himself for his lack of faith, his love and was clearly written in the book of Jonah. 
- Here in this book, he recorded that he was a useless servant of God. 
-He recorded the greatness of God’s love and mercy towards the people of Nineveh. 
-His love was selfless and as long as the sinners repent they will receive the forgiveness of God. 
-In this book, God is recorded as God true and full of love. The commission of the book of Jonah is to testify God. 
-What God wants is not a mighty servant but a servant who is 
able to prove and testify the greatness of God. 
-Jonah taught us this that God is great and all of us are not worthy to be his servants

These are the persons that we should exceptionally miss for they give us life lessons for us to emulate. 

Hallelujah all glory to God. Amen
