Recap of part (1):
Psa 121:1-2
A psalm of ascents which would be sung by the people of Israel when they go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They have to appear thrice before the Lord to worship Him. Why is it an ascent though? Jerusalem is on a high elevation. On their journey, they’d pass the Dead Sea which is 400m below sea level. Jerusalem on Mount Zion is 700m above sea level. Imagine ascending from the lowest elevation on earth to a higher elevation. 

When the psalmist says he lifts his eyes to the hills, he’s not expressing his reliance on the hills but on the God that made the hills. 

When David was persecuted, the Gentiles advised him to flee to the hills. But David answered that he would look toward the God of heaven instead. 

The hills impose a threat to the chosen people. Not just because they were surrounded by enemies but also because they were influenced/led astray to worship idols. 

As Christians, we need to understand our help comes from the God who made heaven and earth. 

Start of (2):
1 Kings 18:20-26
Baal was the god of wind and rain. It’s no wonder the Israelites worshipped it. 

Hosea 2:8, 16

Judges 7:1
Why was Gideon also called Jerubaal? Because God wanted him to tear down the altar of Baal his father had (Judges 6:25). This was God’s first instruction to him after being called as a judge. Afraid he would be attacked if he did it in the day, he did it at night. In the morning when the men of the city came to know of this, they wanted to put him to death. Joash, his father, said, “Would you plead for Baal?...If he is a god, let him plead for himself...”. Then they called Gideon Jerubaal from that day forth (v28-32).

The Israelites were heavily influenced by the idolatry of Baal. They even incorporated Baal’s name in the names of their judges. Baal means ‘master’. They recognised Baal and not God as their master.  Why? Human beings want help for their problems that they can see. Contrast this with the psalmist in Psa 121 looks towards an invisible God.

Jer 3:21-23
“Truly, in vain is salvation holed for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly, in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.”

When we meet with problems in life, do WE truly look towards the Lord God in help?

Many Christians say, “My pastor/cell group leader says this...” They don’t rely on God but their leaders instead. There are some who aren’t fervent or zealous for the word of God. They’d rather believe the words of Man, and would rather worship God in their own way. Some only listen to whoever can give them help. 

2 Kings 17:33-34
“They feared the Lord, YET served their own gods”
This was the greatest problem which is applicable to us Christians today too. We may worship God, but what/who do we worship once we step out of church? Perhaps we don’t fall into the trap of worshipping an idol. But Man can create idols in their hearts for satisfaction. They serve themselves instead of God. This is one of the greatest challenges as a Christians. God is usually second place because it’s hard to put Him first. Many Christians feel this isn’t a problem. 

Human beings face two pressures when there’re changes. When the environment changes, what do we do?

2 Kings 6:15
The Syrian king wanted to attack Israel. Elisha the prophet was surrounded by the armies of the Lord. His servant cried out, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?” And Elisha answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us > those who are with them.”

And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes that he may see!”

When the environment changes, and we face with stress and pressures, do we just see the enemies or do we pray for God to open the eyes of our hearts?

Eph 1:16-19
“[I pray] that God...may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling...”
What are the eyes of understanding? Truly believing from the depths of our hearts that the God we can’t see is who we can rely on. 

In Africa, it’s not very safe. People get robbed easily. A fire started and was burning house after house down. People ran to the house which the fire hadn’t reached yet, not to help them, but to steal their things before the fire came. The people in the house were our church members. At a loss, they knelt down to pray. Thank God the wind blew the fire the other way and they were preserved. From whence comes my help?

There’s another enemy we face too.
Rom 7:18-25
We have to fight with our flesh too. And it’s so difficult to fight. It’s so much easier to indulge in our flesh or ignore working on our sinful nature. We lie to ourselves that it’s acceptable. Let us rely on God to be victorious. Do not look lightly upon this enemy. 

Many Christians today allow themselves to be defeated. But from whence comes our help? The Lord who made heaven and earth. We have the Holy Spirit. We have the word of God to guide us. May God help us.
