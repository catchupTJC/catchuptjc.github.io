Part (1) of this sermon mentioned how God is key in building our families, good/bad decisions lead to good/bad outcomes. Abraham was brought up as a good example, and we should emulate him in building altars, leading a life of worship, and persevering in our journey even when things get difficult. Because of the good decisions he made, his family was blessed. 

Lot was brought up as a bad example. Because of his bad decisions, this led to bad outcomes for his family. His children never had the fear of God. Even when God was going to destroy the city, his family continued to linger with disbelief. 

This sermon will discuss two key decisions we need to make as a family:
1. To remain or to return
One may ask, “What will happen if I’ve already made a bad decision and my family is suffering from it?” The story of Naomi and Ruth offers some insight. 

Ruth 1:1-3
This happens in the backdrop of the period of the judges; a period of ups and downs of the faith of the Israelites. They sinned against Him. God gave them up to the people of the land. They suffered great oppressions. They cried out to God. God heard them and raised judges to deliver them. This cycles happened many times over a period of 400 years. The conclusion of the book of Judges (just before the book of Ruth), it says there was no king and everyone did what was right in their own eyes. 

There was a famine in the land at that time. No food. Survival was an issue. The family of Elimelech decided to leave the land of Israel/Bethlehem to the land of Moab. This was a decision right in their own eyes. It seemed the most logical thing to do. If they had remained, they might have perished. 

Elimelech made that decision and led his family to Moab. We know this decision was bad. Why? Elimelech died. His 2 sons took gentile wives - a great evil in the eyes of God. Both of them died. In the words of Naomi, “Do not call me Naomi (sweet) but Marah (bitter). I went out full but came back empty. The Almighty has afflicted me.” (v20-21)

When Naomi returned, she knew the decision her husband made was a bad one. We now have here a family who made a bad decision. God was definitely displeased. But good thing was that they knew how to return. This was a good decision for the family. Why? As the story unfolds, Ruth the Moabitess found favour in the eyes of Boaz. Playing the role of the close relative, Boaz bought over what was Elimelech’s and took Ruth as wife to perpetuate the name of the dead. Later, King David was a descendant or here. It drew Ruth into the genealogy of Jesus eventually.  

What started out tragic had a perfect ending. This arose because a right decision arose after a bad one: to return. 

What Ruth said to Naomi in Ruth 1:16-17 reflects her faith and determination to follow Naomi. 

Firstly, let us not make the wrong decision. If our family is already in the grace and blessing of God, let us not choose to leave. There can be hardships, but we still have the grace and blessings of God. But if we have already made the decision to leave, let us make the decision to return. Just like Naomi. We can also be determined like Ruth to remain in His grace. Make it right while there’s still the opportunity to do so. 

This is in line with all 8. We hope and pray our family can come in and return.

2. To choose to serve God
Joshua 24:14-15
Joshua reminded the people what God had already done for them - brought their fathers out of Egypt, delivered them from bondage and he hand of pharaoh and his armies, led them to cross river Jordan, conquer Jericho which seemed impossible, conquer the land of Israel in the north and south conquers. God sent hornets to drive people out! God gave them this land that they never owned. Cities they didn’t build. They now live in them. Eating from the vineyards. Enjoying olive growths they didn’t plant. 

Joshua wanted to remind them it’s only for of God that all these things were given to them. God was truly their commander who led them from victory to victory. 

Since God was the one that brought them to this height, isn’t He also the one that can bring them down? That’s why they need to fear the Lord who has this power. 

Joshua’s own personal experience would also have endeavoured to fear God with his family. He was a nobody last time. But though God’s spirit’s working, he became a fighter and a leader. When he reflected upon all the experiences he had of God, he must’ve resulted in a lot of fear and also gratitude in his heart that led him to want to serve God. And he didn’t make this decision on his own, but with his family. And then asked the people to choose for themselves too who they want to serve - the God their fathers serve or the gods of the Amorites. 

Likewise, fearing and serving God today is a conscious choice we and our families have to make. Jesus has told us no one can serve two masters. We will love one and hate the other. We’re not to serve mammon but God. We’re to be loyal to God and not the world. Logically, we know we shouldn’t serve mammon. But in reality, what do we do? How can we always choose to serve God and nor mammon? How can we practically carry out this decision?

The important thing is our heart. In our families, we know it’s not always God VS the world. We still need to decide where to send our children to school, which job we want. The important thing is whether God or mammon is in our heart. 

Josh 24:23
When leaving the land, the people had to make many decisions like us too. “You must incline your heart towards God.” This we must do. For us today, we have our work, studies, many priorities. How can we fulfil them while making a conscious decision towards God? Incline our hearts. This means leaning towards God. 

If we have to choose between attending a spiritual meeting as a family or going for a holiday as a family, we need to incline our hearts to attend Spiritual Meeting. There’re many family activities too. E.g. Family Day. Incline our hearts by prioritising these activities. 

We can also serve God in our families and homes. Part (1) of this sermon discussed setting up a family altar; spending time to study the word of God together. 

A poem: the sign of times
They lie on the table, side by side,
The Holy Bible and the TV guide.
One is well worn and cherished with pride,
No, not the Bible, but the TV guide.
One is used daily to help folks decide,
No, not the Bible but the TV guide.
As the pages are turned, what shall they see? 
Oh what does it matter, turn on the TV.

Then confusion reigns, they can't all agree,
On what they should watch on the old TV.
So they open the book in which they confide:
No, not the Bible, but the TV guide.
The word of God is seldom read,
Maybe a verse as they fall into bed,
Exhausted and sleepy and tired as can be,
Not from reading the Bible, but from watching TV.

So then back on the table side by side,
Lie the Holy Bible and the TV guide.
No time for prayer, no time for the word,
The plan of salvation is seldom now heard.
But forgiveness of sin, so full and free,
Is found in the Bible, not on the TV.

We can apply this in our lives by replacing the TV with something we often do at home/with our family.

What do we choose?

According to Nelson 2016, many families watch tv when spending time together. Increasingly, online videos as well (54% in 2015 overall, 89% amongst the millennials). We need to be careful of the TV and online videos displacing our family time with God. 

Remember to incline our hearts towards God. 

Joshua 24:24-25
What’s significant here is the choice the people made to serve God. It happened in Shechem which is significant because that’s where Abraham first built an altar (Gen 12:6-8). Abraham came to the promised land of Canaan but there were already people in the land. Still he built an altar, a display of his conscious decision to serve God. 

Likewise the people during Joshua’s time made a conscious decision to serve God. 

Shechem means ‘shoulder’. To shoulder a burden. This is voluntary. 

Abraham made a voluntary decision to listen to God’s voice, build an altar and shoulder the responsibility to serve God. 

The people in Joshua’s time also made the voluntary decision to shoulder the responsibility to serve God. 

Today, the decision we make (with our family) should be voluntary too. 

Has our journey of faith come to Shechem? Have we led our families to Shechem?

“Far be it from us that we should forsake God to worship other gods. For the Lord our God is He who brought us and our fathers from the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. Who did all these great signs in our sight, preserved us in all the way we went, and drove out the people in the land.”

We should all aspire to reach Shechem at some point in our faith. Not only is, but bring our families along. Voluntarily want to shoulder the responsibility to serve God. And serve with great gladness. 

In conclusion:
Psa 100:2-3
Let us serve God with gladness. Choose serving Him as a family. Know that the Lord is God. He made us and we are the sheep of His pasture. Since He is God, let us return to Him if we’ve gone the wrong way, because we’re His sheep after all.
