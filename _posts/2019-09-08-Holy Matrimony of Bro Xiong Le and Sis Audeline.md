We turn to Genesis 2:21-24; 
21 “And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 
22 Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 
23 And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.” 
24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”

We know from here that God instituted marriage.You need to manage your marriage according to the commandments of the Bible and God’s purpose. Though you leave your parents today and are joint together, don’t forget the 5th commandment to honour your parents. Spend time with them because they Long for your presence. Let us read Genesis 2:18; 

"And the LORD God said, “ It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”"

Here says that the Creator who created men and women said that it’s not good for man to be alone. God has provided you (Xiong Le) a helper to help you. 

The speaker will now speak to Audeline with Proverbs 19:14; 

“Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD."

Your parents have raised and provided for you, you have been educated and trained, and you’re equipped with skills to manage your marriage. Audeline, let your beauty be an incorruptible beauty, this is very precious in the sight of God. 

(Sorry didn’t get this part, had to go out of the hall! 😓)

We read 1 Peter 3:7; 

"Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered."

To Xiong Le, think of how you can give honour to your wife, because she is a weaker vessel. You have to handle and treat her with care. Give her the honour by appreciating the many roles she has. Cherish, protect and not let her suffer iniquity. When we talk about the weaker vessel, it doesn’t mean, “I’m the head, I’m more superior than you”. 

The speaker shall use an analogy of the telephone. Adam was created and then Eve. In earlier times we know of the telephone then the cordless phone. Xiong Le is like the cordless phone; big and sturdy, durable, the stronger vessel in this aspect. When it is dropped on the floor, you won’t worry it’ll spoil because you can still pick it up. 

The weaker vessel is like the smart phone; you cannot drop it on the ground, but it has many functions. As a helper, there’ll be blind spots you cannot see but she will be the extra pair of eyes to warn you. She will have many functions like a smart phone. You’ll realise that the weaker vessel is a later version of the phone with many functions and good qualities. 

The speaker’s wife helps him to lock the door every night and in his mind he thinks, “SG is already quite safe. You turn the key and the door is locked. Then there are still many layers of lock, including with the door’s security, and every morning he has to open many layers of locks.” Later he realised that she thinks much deeper than he.  He thought that SG’s HDB is very safe, and there may need not be so many locks. Later she told him, that when she locks the door it is God’s providence to this family that every member of the family has returned home safely. 

Appreciate your wife for sometimes thinking more than you. When we talk about the stronger and weaker vessel, one aspect is a loaf of bread. If she doesn’t like the crust, then you’ll have to eat the crust (but good for you because she’s okay with either!).  

Next time when you have a car and she says that she’s tired, you will be the driver (though she can’t drive yet.. haha). When you’re tired, she can help you with the rest of the journey. You are paired together as heirs with the grace of life. The grace of life enters together into the kingdom, to help each other to perfect each other. Both of you will enter into God’s kingdom together. 

Here in 1 Peter 3:7 says that your prayers may not be hindered. Make decisions together in prayer, and have God in your relationship. There will be arguments, times of disagreement and times you don’t want to pray with each other out of anger. When this happens, prayers are hindered, and this is an early sign of detection. It starts with minute problems. It may become serious, and may escalate. But if both of you pray together regularly, you’ll detect that when you don’t want to pray with each other, there’s a problem. Try to de-escalate the problem. 

The speaker believes that with God in your relationship, if you walk according to His commandments, God will be there to guide you to solve the problems in your marriage. 

May God bless your marriage. The speaker congratulates the couple for finding each other. When you’re seated here with the congregation before God, you’ve found the right one. You shouldn’t think if he/she is the right one, it’s a covenant before God. With God’s guidance you’ll be able to walk joyfully together into His kingdom.
