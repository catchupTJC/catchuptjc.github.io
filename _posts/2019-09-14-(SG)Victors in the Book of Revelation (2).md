Jesus doesn’t want us to fail but to be victorious.

Rev 2:9-10  
The church of Smyrna didn’t have any wrong behaviours criticised by the Lord. The problem they faced was tribulation but through the help of the Lord, they were victorious over this tribulation. 

What were they victorious over?  
1. They were victorious over tribulation and poverty  
Both of these things tend to come together. For example if a believer is imprisoned, their financial source would be affected and the family would suffer. Or if your employer knows your Christian, you may lose your job as a result. It may be difficult to find an ideal job; you may need to be a labourer; your life may end up in poverty. Therefore poverty can be a trial in our life of faith. In times of poverty can we still hold on to our faith? Would we murmur against the Lord during times of poverty? If we were thou faced with poverty, we have to remind ourselves not to murmur, and not to murmur against our God. Because our Lord led a life of poverty for our sakes. “Foxes have holes. Birds of the air have nests. But the son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” For our sakes, He was willing to lead such a life of poverty. Should we not also be willing to lead a life of poverty for the sake of our Lord?

Luke 6:20  
“Blessed are you poor, for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven.”  
Jesus says blessed are you poor. Many poor believe in Jesus. Many hope the Lord will bless them with food so they don’t live a life of poverty anymore. Many of us don’t want to lead a life of poverty, because it doesn’t seem to be a blessing. But Jesus’ teaching here is that it is a blessing to be poor! An astonishing teaching! We usually ask the Lord to bless us so we can come out of poverty. But Jesus says the poor are blessed because theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. It’s easier for the poor to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. It’s difficult for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Those who are rich please don’t misunderstand, it’s difficult not impossible for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. There have been rich people who were able to enter heaven, they weren’t bound down by their riches. 

It’s easier for the poor to enter heaven because they only have Jesus as their source of comfort and hope. We have some churches whose members are very poor. Some go hungry while praying. Some have sicknesses while praying. The tears they shed are more than the words they speak. They don’t have much to say while praying but they have such desire to put their hope in Jesus. When they call to mind the poverty of their Lord and His sufferings on the cross, they’re filled with thanksgiving and don’t murmur against God. They’re therefore willing to suffer poverty, they don’t ask the Lord to change their environment. They also don’t have much possessions but they’re spiritually rich. They’re truly victors of poverty. 

On the contrary, there’re churches whose members are very rich. For example, the church in Singapore (according to a Taiwanese preacher who visited HAHA). We haven’t met with tribulation. We’re not really poor. Even if you are, the government has benefits to help them. 

But some members don’t have much strength in their prayer. When listening to sermons, they’re half asleep. They’re waiting for the preacher to say ‘amen’ to end the sermon/prayer. Others are filled with murmurings in their hearts. With regards to physical possessions, we’re rich. But spiritually, we’re in poverty. 

The church in Smyrna had to endure much tribulation and poverty. Through the help of the Lord, they were able to overcome this. This is what we need to learn. 

2. They were able to overcome being maligned  
Luke 6:20  
“I know the blasphemy of those who say they’re Jews and are not”

The Jews in Smyrna blasphemed the Christians there. They invented many lies to bring charges to the Christians, causing them to go through tribulation. They weren’t Jews but a synagogue of Satan. The Jews were the people of God but they willingly became the people of Satan to blaspheme the people of God. Therefore they’re in reality the synagogue of Satan, on the side of Satan not God, attacking the people of God. 

Certain churches face these kind of persecutions. Those who oppose us invent lies to harm us. They claim we go against the law/government. 

Singapore church had to endure such charges before too. We were even accused to the government to be illegal. We have to endure such accusations for the sake of the Lord. 

“I know their blasphemies”  
This is the greatest comfort we can have. God knows. He knows we have been falsely accused of. Don’t think this a suffering but a blessing (不要认为这是一种苦，认为这是一种福)

Matt 5:11  
If we suffer because we’re evil, then we deserve it. But if we’re reviled and persecuted and have all kinds of evil being said against us for the sake of the Lord, it’s a blessing even though we may feel like we’re in a lot of pain when this happens.

If we’re reviled because of our fault, repent and we will once again be accepted. But if we’re reviled for the sake of the Lord, the Lord will bless you. 

Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses. When others speak against us we usually can still endure it but if it’s your own family members, it’s so hard to bear. Others may not understand us well but our family members know us well; their words carry much weight. Others would say “eh that one is your older sis/bro say one leh”. How would you respond? Find them to reason with them?

Moses didn’t confront his siblings. He didn’t speak up not because he didn’t have anything to say but because he knew he didn’t have to. God spoke up for him. “Were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” Sometimes we just say things out of displeasure and unhappiness. But we forget God is listening. Often we speak against someone because we think we can bully them; because they’re people who aren’t of great power. Some men bow their heads humbly outside but beat up their wife and kids at home. You may not fear men but are you sure you don’t fear God?

When God spoke up for Moses, it was then Aaron and Miriam regretted. But it was too late. Miriam contacted leprosy. Aaron immediately repented and asked for forgiveness.

If we’re reviled for the sake of the Lord, one day He’ll avenge you. We’d rather give in than to fight for ourselves. We believe the Lord will bless us. There’ll be a day He avenges us. 

3. They were able to overcome persecution  
“Indeed the devil will throw some of you into prison”  
By throwing only SOME was the devil’s ploy of making people afraid to deny the Lord. But these few still obeyed. 

“Do not be afraid those things you’re about to suffer. Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of life”  
When they were captured and killed, they weren’t afraid nor did they give up on their faith. Through the Lord, they were able to overcome persecutions and provide a beautiful testimony that moved many to resolve to strengthen their faith. 

John warned them beforehand they’d be tested, which would be severe. The devil will throw some of them into prison. They would have tribulation 10 days. How would they overcome? By being faithful unto death. The Lord had already prepared them so that when tribulation comes along, they won’t think the Lord has forgotten about or left them. 

They’ll know all these events are under the control of the Lord. But they first had to undergo testing. All tribulations are under the control of the Lord. How do we know this? Jesus says here that the devil is about to throw some of them into prison. “Some of you” shows the event is in the control of the Lord. He didn’t allow everyone to be thrown in. It would be best if the opposition manages to throw everyone in. Or it’ll be good to throw in all the leaders and preachers. But God didn’t allow this. The Lord only allowed SOME to be thrown in. This shows He’s in control. The devil isn’t allowed to harm everyone. 

Were the few who were thrown into prison unfortunate? “Why me? Why not him?” they may have asked. 

But these few were witnesses the Lord specially chosen. Not everyone can be a martyr for Christ. Only a select few are given this honour. They were chosen because the Lord knows they have faith strong enough to withstand. They would be willing to be faithful unto death; able to fight the good fight for the Lord. The Lord would also give them strength. He tells them not to fear. 

They held on to their faith. They bore a good and beautiful testimony for us. When they hold on, the rest of the members’ faith would be strengthened. 

We may have to face this one day. Hold on to the word of the Lord so we can be victors and not failures when we meet with such tribulations. 

Jesus says they’d face tribulations 10 days. Some people say 10 days is 1/3 of a month which is a short period of time. Some people say the 10 days is symbolic of the 10 persecutions the Roman emperors inflicted on the Christians. 

The first Christian persecution was by emperor Nero in 54AD. They set fire on the city of Rome and put the blame on the Christians. Many were martyred for Christ. The first great perfection they underwent. 

There were 9 other persecutions. The 10th was the most severe. This was in the year 284AD. The Roman emperor Diocletian who said all were to worship the emperor as God. He captured and killed many Christians. This was likened to the darkest period before the sun rose.

In 313AD, emperor Constantine believed and gave an imperial edict not to persecute Christians. Christians could them breathe a sigh of relief. 

In history, there were more than 10 persecutions but the ones mentioned were the big ones. Hence some people think the 10 days represent the 10 big persecutions. Whether it’s the case or not, we know the church was persecuted. What more in the last days we’re going to face greater persecutions and tribulations. Jesus warns us of this not to frighten us but to tell us the reality. He wants us to be victorious over these tribulations. Let us hold on to the words of Jesus or we won’t be able to stand firm. 

There’s a legend in church history. There were 40 roman soldiers who believed in Christ but were discovered and captured. The Roman emperor, angry, put them all in a river in winter to die in the cold. He gave them the chance that if they couldn’t take it they could come on shore and their lives would be spared. But these 40 soldiers endured the cold. But towards the end there was a soldier couldn’t take it and ran to shore. At the same time a soldier on shore started running into the river. As they crossed paths, the soldier running up asked why the other soldier was running down.  
“If you heard and seen what I have, you wouldn’t run up to shore!”  
“What have you heard and seen?”  
“Can’t you hear the angels singing? 40 martyrs, 40 crowns above their heads! But there’s one crown hanging there because you gave up. If you don’t want, I want it!”

We may to face such a test one day. We don’t need to see this vision to believe but the Lord has already told us that we need to endure and we will receive the crown of life. All of us want this so we can go heaven. But the crown of life is only given to those faithful UNTO DEATH. If we give up at the end, we won’t receive it. Does that mean we all need to be martyred? No. Only a few are specially chosen by the Lord. But all of us need to be faithful unto death. From the time we believe until we die, we must not change our faith. This is what it means to be faithful unto death. Don’t think this means we’ll need to be killed. Not all are chosen to be martyred. If we are chosen though, we shouldn’t fear but view it as an honour. These martyrs were special witnesses. But in terms of time, all of us have to be faithful unto death. Don’t change or give up on our faith till the day we die. 

He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death. 

Rev 21:7-8  
When the Lord comes to judge on the last day, these sinners will have a part in the lake of fire. This is the second death. But those who hold on to their faith unto death shall not have to suffer the second death. The Lord will give them the crown of life. May the Lord help us that we may be able to become victors in the life of faith; to put on the crown of life.
