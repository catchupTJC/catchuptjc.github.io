1 Cor 6:16  
Paul corrects a misconception of the Corinthian believers. A lot of people have the idea that it’s acceptable if we act on our impulse and desires. Humans have desires so it’s only right we satisfy that human desire. Here says “with a harlot”. They think it’s nothing wrong and that they’re just satisfying their desire. Just as the previous verse says “food for the stomach, the stomach for food”. This is also a common argument. “If it’s natural; if it feels good, you can do it.”

Paul corrects this here. He says this desire can only be satisfied between man and wife. In fact, physical intimacy between a man and women shouldn’t be taken lightly, for the two shall become one flesh. Therefore if you’re joined to a harlot, you become one body with the harlot. That’s why Paul says you can’t be joined with anyone except your lawfully wedded wife. The relationship between man and wife can be said to be the most intimate human relationship. The most intimate relationship is not between friends. 

Many years ago after the speaker’s A Levels, he spent a lot of time in church. Especially after youth service, they’d play ping pong with Dn Ezra, Sis Rina and Bro Chung Pow. Dn Ezra wasn’t married then. He’d spend hours with them until 7+/night. While single he had a lot of time and spent a lot of time with the speaker and current Pr Chong. Then he got married. Pr Chong complained that Dn Ezra didn’t spend time with them anymore. The speaker said, “Aiyo that is his wife. We’re just his friends. In fact it’s not like we accompany him. It’s more like he accompany us!”

The most intimate human relationship is between husband and wife. It’s not between parents and children. Parents and children are very close. 

One time when the speaker was young, he thought the world revolves around him. He asked his father, “Am I the most important person to you?”  
“You’re the only one who asks such rubbish questions leh!” “The most important person is my wife la!”

That’s correct because they’re one flesh.

The most intimate human relationship. 

But there’s a relationship that’s even more intimate. 

1 Cor 6:17  
When you’re joined to your wife, you’re one flesh with her. When you’re joined to the Lord, you’re one Spirit. One flesh with your wife but one SPIRIT with God. The Bible often describes that the church as a WHOLE as the bride of Christ. But individually, each and everyone of us must be joined to the Lord. 

Only he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him. This is the MOST important relationship. 

When one is young, he probably thinks the most important thing is to marry his first love. He/she must be the only one! Sometimes young people think they’ll die if they don’t get married to their one and only first love. Some people do marry their first love but there’s no guarantee. There’s no command in the Bible that you have to marry your first love. You must love the one you marry, but you will not necessarily marry your first love. No one necessarily dies because they don’t marry their first love. There’s no definite one and only one destined for you. God has a put a boundary: marry within the Lord. Within this boundary, you can choose the one you like. Of course, choose based on godly criteria as well. But there’s no definite must be this one or must be that one. 

But with regards to joining in the spirit, we can only join to only ONE. And we’ll really/surely die if we aren’t joined to the Lord. There’s no more important relationship. This relationship should hence occupy our thoughts and kinds. It should always be the number one relationship in our lives. To be joined to the Lord in one sport should be the aim of every Christian. 

How can we be joined the Lord in one spirit?  
1 Cor 6:19-20  
To be one spirit in the Lord, His Holy Spirit must first dwell in you. Which is why praying for the Holy Spirit is so important in the True Jesus Church. If we don’t have the Holy Spirit, how can we be one spirit with Him? To have His spirit dwell in us is the most intimate thing that can happen between a human and God. 

No matter how much a husband and wife love each other, they can’t they can’t guarantee they’d always be there for each other. One may die before the other. But the Bible tells us His spirit will ALWAYS be with us, and He’ll be with us forever. 

We must first receive the Holy Spirit to be one spirit with Him. 

2 Pet 1:4  
To be one spirit with the Lord, we must be partakers of the the divine nature. The world today often employs weird arguments. For example a friend of the speaker told him: look at the animal kingdom. 8-10% of animals are homosexuals. Therefore homosexuality is natural and justifiable. Animals murder too. Is murder justifiable? We’re not partakers of some beast, we’re partakes of the divine nature. 

To be one flesh with your wife, you don’t have to be partakers of your wifely nature. There’s no command to be like your spouse. Many couples are different and accept each other’s differences. In fact some couples thrive on this kind of differences. They find if they don’t quarrel there’s no excitement in life. A Middle Eastern couple got divorced. The reason? “My husband always gives in to him. He never quarrels. He always cooks. He does all the housework. When I try to quarrel with him, he never quarrels back. He even buys presents to appease me. I don’t like this kind of husband, no excitement in life.” Too good already lol. Some people are strange. 

But then to be one spirit with God, we must change. We cannot say accept me for what I am. We just be partakers of the the divine nature. We must be transformed. The spirit of the Lord must transform us. 

1 Cor 6:13-14  
Of course, food is for the stomach, stomach is for the food. If food is not for the stomach, what do you cook food for? This is natural so why isn’t it right? The body is more than all these things. It’s not just to satisfy physical desires. The body is MORE than these things. God will destroy the food and the stomach. But what about the body? The Lord is FOR the body. Why? Because He died for us so that we’ll be raised by Him on the last day. Our body will be transformed from a natural one to a spiritual one. This body is special. How then can we use this body just to satisfy our desired? The body is not for sexual immorality. What is it for? For the Lord, just as the Lord is for us.

To be one spirit with the Lord, it depends on how we use this body as well. We must dedicate this body for us just as the Lord gave His one body for us.
