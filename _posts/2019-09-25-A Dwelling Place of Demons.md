Some people believe old and dilapidated houses are haunted. We’ve heard ghost stories in army, some people have seen their dead relatives at home. What does the Bible tell us about demons and their dwelling place?

The devil doesn’t only want to dwell in army camps and abandoned buildings. He wants to dwell in the hearts of men. 

What are the dwelling places of the devil?
1. A greedy heart 
John 13:27 Judas
Prov 16:18
Acts 5:3-4 Ananias and Sapphira 

2. A heart of doubt/disbelief
Gen 3:1-6
Satan tries to sow seeds of doubt in our hearts. Here he made Eve think that God was keeping something good from her; he made her doubt that God was giving her the best. 

It is when we’re going through something difficult, for example you’re suddenly told you have cancer, that’s when the devil capitalises on your vulnerability to sow seeds of doubt. When you’re in pain, when you have trouble, you may start to wonder why God allowed this to happen to you. Be careful not to have a heart of doubt that the devil will want to dwell in. 

3. A heart of jealousy 
Cain killed Abel because he was jealous. 

1 Sam 18:8
Saul was jealous of David. Because he didn’t manage his heart of jealousy, God’s spirit left him and a distressing spirit came to bother him.

Having a heart of pride, doubt, jealousy gives room for the devil to work.    

Eph 2:2
Be careful not to let the devil occupy and corrupt our hearts. 

Col 3:16
Constantly let the word of God dwell in our hearts. Study the word of God and come for services for mutual exhortation. Read and meditate on the word of God at home. Let the word of God dwell richly in your heart - that’s the best way to resist the devil. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God by studying God’s words. 

If we don’t attend services regularly and don’t read the word of God, we’d be easily corrupted by the world and the devil. Our hearts may be

God wants to dwell in us. He wants to give us the Holy Spirit. We want the spirit of God to dwell on us to produce the fruit of the Spirit. Instead of having pride, to have humility. Instead of having doubt and anxiety, to have peace and joy. Instead of having jealousy, to have goodness, kindness, gentleness. 

Let us nurture our hearts spiritually to bear the fruit of the Spirit and to be more Christ like. Don’t let our hearts become the dwelling place of demons.
