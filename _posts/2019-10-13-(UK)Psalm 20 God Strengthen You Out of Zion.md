“May He send you help from the sanctuary,
And strengthen you out of Zion;”
(Psalm 20:2)
 
God sends us help from the sanctuary and strengthens us out of Zion. This means that God strengthens us out of the church. This is why it is so important for us to have faith in God and His church.
 
“May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble;
May the name of the God of Jacob defend you;”
(Psalm 20:1)
 
Today, most of us, if not all of us, have been through some kind of trouble. Physical trouble, spiritual trouble… we’ve all been through different troubles. But why is it that we are able to endure? Because strength comes out of Zion.
 
““Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.””
(Matthew 18:19-20)
 
Today, if you are going through some spiritual challenges, you need to come to church. Because God is the one who will strengthen us out of Zion. Because we will pray for one another. If we turn back to Psalms 20, in the English version, it says, “May the name of the God of Jacob defend you.” Today, how do we experience this? Today, we may not have physical enemies. But we have spiritual enemies. Some people have experienced being possessed by evil spirits. Or they have been troubled by evil spirits before. So how did God defend them?

“And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;”
(Mark 16:17)
 
In Jesus’ name, demons are cast out. So this is not only happening to our believers, it even happens to truth-seekers. Just during the Spiritual Convocation in Forest Hill, London, a truth-seeker came to the church. We cast out the evil spirit in the name of Jesus. We prayed for the person, and the person received the Holy Spirit. The name of the God of Jacob will defend us. That is how we have strength out of Zion.
 
“May He send you help from the sanctuary,
And strengthen you out of Zion;”
(Psalm 20:2)
 
We may say, how can this happen? If we look at John 20:21-22, we see that Jesus breathed on His disciples, and He said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Jesus sent them. So why is it that strength and help will come out of Zion? Because God will send people by the Holy Spirit. Not only preachers. Even brothers and sisters. Because God will send them to help us.
 
“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.”
(1 Corinthians 12:4-11)
 
This passage talks about the gifts of the Holy Spirit. We can see different gifts. Really, there is a member, who speaks in tongues and the Holy Spirit gave the gift to be able to translate the tongues. This person was just a member, not a preacher. Different gifts are given to different people. Brothers and sisters, if we have the heart to love one another, if you have love in your hearts, if you want to let God fulfill His promise, then we need to pray to God, to give us the Holy Spirit and to give us gifts of the Holy Spirit. We must also pray for other brothers and sisters to have gifts of the Holy Spirit. Because if we look into 1 Corinthians 12, this reminds us that
 
“There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all:”
(1 Corinthians 12:4-7)
 
“But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.”
(1 Corinthians 12:11)
 
So today if we desire the church to be stronger, if we want brothers and sisters’ faiths to be stronger and to be helped, then we need to pray for gifts. We need to ask God to give us different gifts, and to give different gifts to different people.
 
“May He remember all your offerings,
And accept your burnt sacrifice.”
(Psalm 20:3)
 
We thank our Lord Jesus Christ. We have heard the teaching that when we love our brothers and sisters in Christ, we love Jesus. Why would a person offer and make sacrifice? Why? Because they want to please God. So today, if you want to please God, and you want to help the church, you want to strengthen brothers and sisters, then God will remember everything you do for Him. God will remember. God will never forget.
 
“Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ”
“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.””
(Revelations 14:13)
 
If you are willing to be used by God to help other people, God will remember what you do.
 
“May He grant you according to your heart’s desire,
And fulfill all your purpose.”
(Psalm 20:4)
 
Every one of us have different desires. We also have different purposes. Sometimes, we pray for things and ask God for things but we do not know if God will answer. Isn’t that true/ But imagine: if you have a desire and a purpose and everything you ask for, God will answer! Do you believe that? You may say, “Yeah, on a good day. But it may not be possible.” But imagine. If you have God’s desire as your desire, God’s purpose as your purpose, do you think God would not answer your prayers? If your desire is God’s desire, and your purpose is God’s purpose, do you not think that God would grant your heart’s desire? We need to make up our minds.
 
““Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.”
(John 14:12-14)
 
You know, God is very merciful. Sometimes, we have needs and we ask God to help us. But did you know that it is meant to be a stepping stone to grow our faith? Because God gives us an experience to ask in His name. We ask, and God answers. We are then meant to use that developed faith to ask things for His church, to pray for spiritual matters, matters regarding the faith and spirituality of our brothers and sisters. Thank god. There is a sister who has a husband. The husband’s faith is not very good, but she has experienced God many times. So she said to God, “Please, help my husband’s faith!” She cried out to God. “God, I want my husband to be Your worker.” From man’s point of view, it was impossible, for he was very stubborn. But thank God. The wife continued to pray for the husband. And because the sister’s desire was God’s desire, because she had a purpose that was also God’s purpose, when she asked, God answered her prayer. Not only did he change spiritually, his mind changed, his heart changed, his attitude towards life changed. He became less worldly and more spiritual. He even began to have stronger faith and to rely on prayer more. Additionally, he also became an RE teacher and influenced his students positively. When his father was ill, a student came to him and said, “I prayed for your father.” This brother’s heart was touched. Where did this benefit come from? Because the sister’s desire was God’s desire. God’s purpose was the sister’s purpose.
 
“Here am I and the children whom the Lord has given me!
We are for signs and wonders in Israel
From the Lord of hosts,
Who dwells in Mount Zion.”
(Isaiah 8:18)
 
Here, we can see that he dose not just say, “Here am I, send me.” He says, “Here am I and the children whom the Lord has given me.” Isaiah, the prophet, wanted he and his whole family to be spiritual signs for the people of God. Today, if we imitate Isaiah’s prayer, do you think you need to worry about your children’s faith in the future? Do you need to over-worry? You won’t. Because you already have God’s desire.
 
“We will rejoice in your salvation,
And in the name of our God we will set up our banners!
May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.”
(Psalm 20:5)
 
Zion is talking about the church. And now, we remember from Isaiah 11 that God sets up the banner twice.
 
““And in that day there shall be a Root of Jesse,
Who shall stand as a banner to the people;
For the Gentiles shall seek Him,
And His resting place shall be glorious.”
It shall come to pass in that day
That the Lord shall set His hand again the second time
To recover the remnant of His people who are left,
From Assyria and Egypt,
From Pathros and Cush,
From Elam and Shinar,
From Hamath and the islands of the sea.
He will set up a banner for the nations,
And will assemble the outcasts of Israel,
And gather together the dispersed of Judah
From the four corners of the earth.”
(Isaiah 11:10-12)
 
Verse 10 talks about Jesus. Jesus is the Root of Jesse. And Jesus “shall stand as a banner to the people”. When the Gentile seeks God, it means that the apostolic church has reached to the Gentiles. When we look at verse 11, it tells us that “the Lord shall set His hand again the second time”. The second time! If you look at verse 12, it tells us that “He will set up a banner for the nations”. Thank God. This is the setting up of the restored apostolic church, True Jesus Church. Twice.
 
Now, let me ask you a question. Have we ever thought, “Oh, if only I saw Jesus, then my faith would be stronger”? Or, “Oh, if only we had a very powerful worker and God would be able to revive us”? But. brothers and sisters, how is God going to perfect and fully restore His church in the end times? Let’s go back to Psalm 20:5.
 
“We will rejoice in your salvation,
And in the name of our God we will set up our banners!
May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.”
(Psalm 20:5)
 
The speaker is not the oldest in the congregation. There are many who have been in the congregation longer than he has been. Why was it that the church of God was set up? At the beginning, it is always the most difficult. Many prayers were offered. So perhaps in the past, we may have said, “Oh, having a youth fellowship is so difficult to organize and keep it going! It’s impossible!” Where are we now? We have more than one youth fellowship. Here is another one. Brothers fellowship is new. But it is important! We may find it difficult. So what shall we do? So the sisters, just fold their arms, “Come on brothers, do your thing!” No, you wouldn’t do that, isn’t it? Because you have experienced setting up Sisters’ fellowship. The church prayed for Sisters’ fellowship, and gradually, it grew. As brothers and sisters, we must also pray for Brothers’ fellowship as well. Because according to the Bible, in the name of our God we will set up our banners—because we pray about it. We bless each other in the name of Jesus. That is why things will happen. Don’t forget, we are priests!
 
““Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the way you shall bless the children of Israel. Say to them:
“The Lord bless you and keep you;
The Lord make His face shine upon you,
And be gracious to you;
The Lord lift up His countenance upon you,
And give you peace.” ’
“So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.””
(Numbers 6:23-27)
 
We all believe in the name of Jesus, even to cast out demons, isn’t it? We all believe in praying in the name of Jesus to receive the Holy Spirit. So since we have such great faith, why don’t we bless each other for the sake of the church of God? Because that is how God will prosper His church. When we look into 2 Corinthians 12:9, know that Paul’s experience is for our reference.
 
“And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”
(2 Corinthians 12:9)
 
So today if you find that your numbers are few, that’s good. Why? Because that is how God works. God will always use just a few people at the beginning. It is not how many people there are at the beginning, or how strong the few people are. It is what they believe that is the most important.
 
“Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the Lord will work for us. For nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few.””
(1 Samuel 14:6)
 
Then you may say, “How do I know that it will happen or that the situation will improve?” You may say, “I feel it will not happen.” Why? Are you so powerful? You feel it would not happen and so it would not happen? Are you that amazing? Is your feeling greater than what God has promised He will do? Is that true evidence of the future? It is not true evidence. Therefore, today, we can say to ourselves that there is nothing to determine that things will not progress.
 
Abraham “contrary to hope, in hope believed”
(Romans 4:18a)
 
This shows us that Abraham ignored the obvious and hoped in God’s promise. That’s all he did. He never mixed together God’s promise with the feelings in his heart because of what he saw. He just ignored what he saw and his feelings to believe totally in God’s promise. If we want to do God’s work, if we want God to bless us, we need to clean out our heart of unbelief. That is the barrier to God’s work. So when others want to build up the church, do not say, “I don’t know how long you will last.” Don’t say that. Don’t say that. If you don’t have faith, keep your mouth shut. Otherwise you may disturb God’s work. Actually, you should open your mouth to pray to God to bless them.
 
““When leaders lead in Israel,
When the people willingly offer themselves,
Bless the Lord!”
(Judges 5:2)
 
That’s what we should do. To bless the Lord! When you see that there are brothers or sisters wanting to strengthen other people’s faiths, we need to say, “Hallelujah!” and bless them, and bless the Lord. That’s what we should do. If you cannot say such a thing, there is something spiritually wrong with you. Are you really part of the family? If you are part of God’s family, then bless the family. In the name of Jesus, bless this family. That’s what we should do. Brothers and sisters, the Bible is very clear in saying this: God will strengthen us out of Zion. There is not going to be another true church. We are the only true church. May God bless us.
