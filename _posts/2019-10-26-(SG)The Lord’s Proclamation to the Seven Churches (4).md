We turn to Revelation 2:18; 

'“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, ‘These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass: '

We see how God calls Himself to the church in Thyatira. 

First He calls Himself the Son of God. It tells us that after Jesus was resurrected, He carries with Himself a status as the Son of God because He still has the do the work of intercession in heaven. We turn to Hebrews 7:22-25;

22 'by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant. 
23 Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. 
24 But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. 
25 Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.'

V22 mentions that Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant. Not only has He become a surety of salvation, He has also become the intercession prayers in heaven. He’s praying for us and is able to save to the uttermost those who come to Him through God. Some believers are worried, “Can I be saved in the future? What can I do to receive salvation?” For example, this person is already baptised and received the Holy Spirit but has so many concerns about being saved. The problem lies in if you truly believe in God. If you truly trust in God, are you willing to come before God?

Jesus says for those who come to God through Him, He’ll be able to save to the uttermost. We must trust in God and come before God. Some believers reckon that it’s alright for them to trust in God and do not need to come before God. 

How can we come before God? Coming to the church of God is coming from the Lord. The Bible encourages us to not stop attending services. Although we can continue to pray and come before God at home, coming to church before God is different. Because in church, you’ll hear the words of God encouraging and reminding us. In church, when singing hymns and praying, it’s a direct communication. When you’re in church, you’re all in one body. If we trust in God, you must come before God then you’ll know God will save us to the uttermost. 

We must reflect: have we truly trusted in God? 

Some people propose that not only do we need to pray to Jesus, we also have to pray to Mary. They say that when you pray to Jesus it’s more troublesome because Jesus often don’t hear your prayers. But Jesus is filial to His mother and will listen to His mother. So when you pray to Mary, He’ll have to listen to His mother. 

Such thinking is not in accordance to the Bible and is against the teachings. The Bible tells us that there’s only one intercessor between God and men, and that is Jesus. When you pray to Mary, you have one more intercessor and that no longer makes Jesus the only intercessor. Jesus emphasises that He is the Son of God and not the Son of Mary. Jesus is the only intercessor, and we cannot use someone else or Mary in the place of Him. Sometimes unknowingly we may make this mistake. 

For example, the speaker mom has told him before, “When I pray, Jesus don’t listen, so you have to pray for me.” 

The speaker then replied, “I will pray for you, but you have to pray on your own.” 

“God won’t listen to me when I pray but you’re a worker of God, He’ll definitely listen to you.” 

Saying this, the speaker’s mother has made him an intercessor between her and God, and that is incorrect. 

The speaker will pray for us, but you have to pray on your own. Your prayers and confessions cannot be taken in the place of anyone. You have to come before God in prayer in your own faith. 

The Lord Jesus also calls His eyes as flames of fire. Flames of fires give light in darkness. There’s nothing hidden in darkness that cannot be exposed by this light. This means that whatever we do cannot escape the eyes of God because His eyes are like flames of fire. We turn to Acts 5:1-4; 

1 'But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. 
2 And he kept back part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles’ feet. 
3 But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself? 
4 While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”'

It was the eyes of the Lord that was like the flames and fire that could see. Was it right for Ananias to keep some to himself? It was not wrong. The church had not forced anyone to make a complete offering. It is up to your control how much you want to offer. Ananias’ sin was that he lied to God. 

In those days, many people sold everything they had and offered their earnings the church to control because they reckoned that Jesus would come quickly so there’s no need to have control over their wealth. This is so that everyone had the means to preach the gospel because the Lord is coming soon. Ananias thought that if everyone offered everything they had and he doesn’t, he’d lose face. However if he offered everything, his pockets would be empty. He thought of a method he thought was good, “I offer a part and say that this is everything I have and keep some secretly. Then I’d keep my face and save some of my pockets. Isn’t this a double win?” This win-win method resulted in double death (双赢变成双命). Jesus through Peter rebuked him, “You didn’t lie to men but to God.” In the end, both Ananias and Sapphira died. 

The church was fearful, but this fear was good. This fear cleansed their impurities and deceit in their hearts so they knew that the eyes of our God are like flames of fire. No darkness can escape His sight. 

Pitifully, the church of Thyatira seemed to have forgotten. God reminds them that His eyes are like flames of fires and before God we must be careful of our thoughts if not we will face His judgement. 

God calls His feet like fine brass. Our feet are very important and our whole weight of our bodies rely on our feet. If our feet are hurt, we’re unable to stand. The feet of the Lord Jesus are like fine brass, meaning His feet are strong and resolute. He can trample on all enemies, even the devil. We look at Luke 10:18-19; 

18 'And He said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 
19 Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. '

Some reckoned that satan was in enmity with God in heaven and his power was great. Jesus says otherwise and says, “I saw satan fall like lightning from heaven.” Satan is not that powerful and does not have the authority to withstand God in heaven. He actually fell from heaven. Jesus continues by telling us, “Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. '
”  Not only does Jesus have this power and authority, He also gives it to the church. 

We must know the church. This church is no ordinary organisation or community in the world. This church is the body of Christ and he is carrying out the authority in the church. Through the church, He carries out baptism to wash away our sins, conducts Holy Communion and the footwashing sacraments so we can have a part in our Lord Jesus. The church is important. It’s not just a place of gathering for fellowship, the church has the authority that God has given. If the church doesn’t have the Lord as the head but have men as the head and the believers trust in men and not in God, this means that they listen to the commands of men and not God. then, does this church still carry the authority to trample on enemies? Hence we must listen to the words of the Lord and trust Him wholeheartedly. 

The fine brass also tells us that the judgement of God is just and fair. He will not let go of any sin and He won’t take what is not sin to become sin and not take what is sin to become sin. In the world, such are very common and full of darkness. Sometimes our judgement also isn’t very fair. Isn’t it true that the way you treat your children isn’t very fair at times as well? When the son commits a wrong you chastise but when your daughter makes a fault, you say it’s okay. You have partiality. But God’s judgement is righteous and fair. Judgement starts from the house of God. How does He judge? It’s not, “Oh, you have sinned,” or, “Oh, you have more sins than this other person.” The church has to preach the word of God. The word of God is the word of judgement and those who listen to these words receive forgiveness. The word of judgement now becomes salvation and those who listen will be judged and so the word of God becomes judgement. We must seriously listen to the word of God. These words are no ordinary words and it’s not just wisdom. This is the kind of life and authority that can save and judge your life. This is the word of God. 

We look at Revelation 3:7; 

'“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, ‘These things says He who is holy, He who is true, “He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens” : '

We see how God calls Himself to the church in Philadelphia. First, God says that He is the one who is holy. Even the devil knows that the Lord is holy. In Luke 4:34, the devil told the Lord Jesus; 

'saying, “Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are— the Holy One of God!”'

The devil knows that Jesus is the Holy one of God but their response is of fear. They knew that when Jesus came, it’s to condemn and destroy them. Today we too know that Jesus is the holy one, but what is our response? Do we know that the Lord will come one day to carry out His judgement? When Isaiah saw the glory and holiness of God, he heard the Cherubim call out “Holy! Holy! Holy!” but the response of Isaiah was woe. Why? 

At that time, he realised his sinfulness. When Isaiah faced the congregation, he felt that he was much more holy than them. He only saw the sinful nature of the congregation but when he faced God, when he was faced with the Holy One, he realised how sinful he was. He immediately repented and received forgiveness. If a holy prophet like Isaiah realised his sins, are we not more unholy before God? 

Before God we must be humble and confess our sins. Whether is it our actions, thoughts in our minds, our God sees through our hearts. We must preserve and guard our hearts so that we don’t have evil intentions in our hearts. What’s most important in one's life is not to see the sin in others but the sin in ourselves, like the prophet Isaiah, then you’ll be blessed. 

Then the Lord also says that He has the key of David. To have the key of David tells us that He is in control and has authority over the house of David. The nation of Israel prefigured the heavenly kingdom and Jesus is the king of heaven. He who has the key of David has the key to heaven. Before he ascended to heaven he said to His disciples, “All authority under heaven and earth has been given to Me. You have to go to the world to preach the gospel.” 

This commission to preach the gospel is too great and not something we can undertake. Don’t talk about preaching to the ends of the earth, preaching Singapore is already so difficult. It’s already difficult to even preach in the smaller portions in TK. But the Lord said, “All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Me.” We have this courage and faith to preach the gospel not only our own strength and faith but in the God we believe in. He is the king of heaven and has the keys to heaven. Only He has the authority to open the doors of heaven and has the power to save all who believe. We just have to have faith to preach according to our faith and how effective it is depends on the Lord. The Lord doesn’t worry on how much we work, but whether we’ve ever done the work. We must listen to the words of the Lord to carry out the commission to preach the gospel. No one can be saved and entered heaven except through Him. 

Jesus says, “He who opens, no one shuts.” When the doors of heaven open, it’s when He asks His disciples to preach the gospel. Now the heaven doors are open. In the days of salvation, no one can shut the door to salvation but it doesn’t mean there’s no obstacles. In preaching the gospels, you’ll meet with troubles and obstacles. Although the ones who preach the gospels may be stopped, the gospel won’t be stopped. They can only bite up the preachers of God and not the gospel. 

Just like Paul in prison; the preacher was chained, but the gospel was preached in this way to Rome. Paul brought this gospel to Rome in chains. This is a wonderful work to let us see that this is the way of salvation. Men can bind up the preachers of work, but Jesus says that when this door is open, no one can shut it. 

Similarly, when it shuts, no one is able to open. When the door to salvation grace is closed, that is the time when the day of judgement starts. At this time, do you still want to be baptised and believe in Jesus? You won’t be able to do so. Do you want to offer to church? There is no need for you to do so. Do you want to put in a little more effort to work for the church? There is no need as well. The door is shut and judgment has already begun. 

Now that the door of salvation is open, quickly preach the gospel to the ones we love. There are many joys at things in one’s life, but these important things are no longer important on the day of judgement. What’s most important is that when death comes, you can overcome death. Entering into eternal life is the most important. No one can decide this for you, no one can persuade you, only you can decide your life for yourself. If you are cold and far from God, if you are not serious in our faith, think about whether you still want to continue on like this. 

Why are you not serious over your faith then? Jesus tells us that He is the one who has the key of David. When He opens no one shuts and when He shuts, no one opens. We must seize hold of the opportunity. 

We read Revelation 3:14; 

'“And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, ‘These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God: '

This is how God calls Himself to the church in Laodicea. 

He calls Himself the amen. Amen means “truly truly”.  The apostles, they often said “amen”. After we finish our prayers, we say “amen”, meaning to say that whether in blessings or in prayers, all that we said is true. Don’t be mistaken that “amen” means the end. “Amen” is a very serious word. 

In the Bible it’s used in regards to the word of God, to affirm that the word of God is true. We read Deuteronomy 27:15-16;

15 '‘Cursed is the one who makes a carved or molded image, an abomination to the Lord , the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ “And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen!’
16 ‘Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt.’ “And all the people shall say, ‘Amen!’'

if you carry on reading, every time they proclaim the word of God, the congregation will say “amen”, expressing that they affirm that it is indeed the word of God. If you’ve heard these words of God and you don’t do it, these curses will come on to us. In your hearts when you say “amen”, it’s a very serious thing. You confess that this is the word of God and you resolve to obey the word of God. Then the word of God becomes a source of strength in your heart and this strength can preserve your heart so no sin or defilement can enter your heart and it’s a source of strength for you to bear good fruit. It requires you to say amen then it can become your strength and protection. We hear many words of God but we put them aside after. 

Today when we preach the word of God, we don’t have to say ito it but we have to say it in our hearts. We must say amen because this is truly the words of God. Let’s not just hear the sounds of the words but listen to the words. 

The speaker lives on the third floor and the ground floor is the supermarket. When people talk, he can hear the sound but he must put in effort to listen carefully to what they say. The speaker hears just the noise and not the words. It’s the same when we listen to the word of God. You may be listening but you may only be listening to the sound of the speaker and not the words. 

If you are just hearing the sounds of the words, if after service someone asks you, “Who spoke today?”, perhaps you may be able to answer. 

If they ask, “What words did the speaker speak?”, you may answer, “The words of the Bible.” 

“What words of the Bible?” 

“I’m not so sure”

You must listen carefully, then you can hear the words within the sound. Then you say “amen”, then these words are kept in your hearts. It can become a source of strength. When you’re afraid, these words can help. When you’re sad, these words can comfort. When you feel that life is vain, God will give you strength and hope. This is real. You must experience this for yourself and believe. The speaker can’t say “amen” on your behalf. Saying “amen” is also something you say in your praise to God. We read Psalm 106:48; 

'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord !'

Here the palmist reminds us that we know that the Lord ought to be praised and so in our hymns and praises we praise Him, “Let all the people say amen”. Some hymns are lovely to hear and moves your ears, but have they moved your hearts? Perhaps it moves your external heart, but has it moved the soul within you?

There are many degrees of being moved, but the greatest impact is to the souls and will leave a very deep impression on you and become a source of strength. When we sing hymns and praise God, don’t make it a mere ritual but a true praise from our hearts. Paul says that we must sing with our lips and our hearts must agree. Our hearts must say “amen”, that these words and lyrics are truly true. When we sing this, through the hymns we express our hearts so that the meanings of the hymns enter to the depths of our hearts.

In our hymns of praise we say amen. You’ll find that the word of God and hymns we sing becomes a source of strength in our lives. The Lord also calls Himself a faithful and true witness, so the words of God is something we can believe and trust in. We know that an honest and reliable person is good. Don’t tell lies and don’t open a blank check, that whatever we say is true and faithful, then you’re someone reliable and trustworthy. You may say many beautiful words and blank checks but they’re useless. Every word of Jesus is true. He says, “Heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God lives forever.” 

When you read the Bible, seize hold of every word spoken by God. One day you will understand and know how these words can become your strength. 

Today the world has changed so much. Men are the same as well, they too have changed much. It’s not that they want to change but the environment has changed so much they have no choice but to follow. Don’t murmur against men saying that their words are not trustworthy. We have to come to this realisation to not be trusting in the words of men but to trust in God. It’s difficult for both parties. All of us have our difficult areas, so we don’t have to seize hold to the words of men because  this will dishearten you. We must seize hold to the word of God, then His words can be a source of comfort. When you’re low, you’ll realise that the word of God is with you. All things will change and all things may happen, all the more we should hold on to our Lord. 

God says to the church in Laodicea that he is the beginning of the creation of God. All creation is created through God and all creations are sustained by God. Not only do we know that the Lord created everything, we know that He controls everything. When you hold on to something and you let go, can the item remain in space? Earth is suspended in space, what strength is sustaining it? One day when He is no longer sustaining everything in the universe, it’ll be the day of judgement. All creation will be destroyed. When we’re living in this world, we must believe in this God that sustains all things. He creates and sustains all things so we can enjoy all things. In enjoying all these things, should we not give thanks to the God that sustains all things? Did the church in Laodicea not understand these things? The church has forgotten and did not treat Jesus as the Lord. If they had, it was only the lord on their lips. In their hearts, Jesus was not their Lord. It was wealth. 

However, their money can only buy some things. There are many things your money cannot buy but everyone treats money as their lord. The Lord says to the church Of Laodicea, “I’m standing outside the doors of your heart and you must open it so I can enter.” 

Many Christians don’t have the Lord Jesus in their hearts. As Christians, do we have Christ in our hearts? Who is the true lord in our hearts? Let us open the doors of our hearts and allow Christ to be the Lord of our hearts.
