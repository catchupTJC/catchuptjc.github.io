We turn to 2 Kings 13:14; 

'Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”'

Here records that prophet Elisha had an illness unto death and he gave a teaching to Joash, the king of Israel. Here, Joash cried before Elisha. Elisha understood his cries and told him to shoot the arrow. Elisha asked king Joash to open the window to shoot the arrow, and he did. 

We are always very concerned about the uncertain future because we do not know when disasters or misfortune may happen to us. Prophet Elisha encourages us that this is the Lord’s arrow of victories. If we believe in the presence and blessings of the Lord, we will be able to be at peace. 

The speaker would like to share his testimony. 

He saw a coincidence. When he spoke the sermon on the victorious arrow of 2018 last year, he didn’t know what the future held for him. He realised now the sermon is very meaningful for his present circumstances. In 2018, he had surgery on his artery. In October 2019, he realised a tumour in his colon and the doctor suspected that it was malignant. Before he could settle down, another trouble came. These are big waves that could take away his life. 

He saw another coincidence. Before he spoke on the series on Revelation, he spoke a series on “Hear Them Speak”. As the speaker was about to complete that series, he was considering which series to do next. He thought of speaking on “Hear Them Pray” or “Watch Their Behaviour”. However, he had a feeling to speak on the book of Revelation but thought that Revelation had severe teachings considering rebuke. The speaker thought that if he were to speak on “Hear Them Speak”, it would be more interesting. However, the desire or interest to speak on Revelation became stronger and ultimately he did so. At that time he joked with his wife, “The book of Revelation is the last book of the Bible, would it be my end too after speaking this series?”

His wife rebuked him, “You want to go off so early? There are still so many more sermons for you to speak!” 

The speaker was talking about the victorious ones in the book of Revelation and it came to the tumour that was suspected malignant. The threat of life came to him and he thought that it was the battle he had to fight for his life. Perhaps the battle would be short, or perhaps it may be a prolonged and enduring one. The speaker hoped that it would be short so he wouldn’t have to suffer much. If it were a long battle, not only him but his wife also have to suffer. However, whether a short or long battle, the speaker knew he didn’t have a say. He prayed to God for His mercy to endure to the end. The physical sufferings he has to endure is a bitter cup that he has to drink, and he asked for a half cup instead of a full cup. Whether it is a full or half cup, he asks the Lord to help him drink it completely. 

The speaker’s life as a preacher from the start was a difficult one and on this last day, he knows he has to drink this bitter cup. Sometimes we may think, “Why do some preachers have a cup of blessing?” This is just a thought he had but it doesn’t mean that he regrets becoming a preacher. There is no murmuring and comparison on the path he took. 

The speaker read an article the describes a moth being envious of a butterfly because everyone loves butterflies and describes moth for its appearance. The moth told the creator, “You made me so ugly!” 

The creator replied the moth, “You only need to move most of the time at night, what’s important for you is not your physical beauty (in the night no one appreciates beauty because they can’t see properly). Your role is very important because at night, the flowers bloom and they need pollination. That’s your role. You may not have the physical beauty but you have such an important role. Your role can’t be simply replaced by others.” 

After the moth heard the words of the creator, it didn’t brighten up because the creator spoke to him (just as Moses who glowed after speaking to God), but in his heart there was light. He can see the importance of his role, he understands his directions and objections, so he no longer compares himself with the butterflies and wants to perform his role well.

Likewise, the speaker doesn’t care how people would look down or mock him, he only cares whether he has completed his role. Although the role the speaker took was a little more difficult, along the way he experienced the grace of God. For example, when the speaker finished his work of 25 years and retired, he came back to Singapore because the Singapore church was able to accept his works of just pulpit ministry and he need not attend meetings or visiting works. As a full-time preacher, it’s not possible to choose the work delegated to you. Whether it is on or off the pulpit, you have to be responsible for all the work. After your retirement, you can choose what you want to work (subject to the church’s approval). 

The speaker is thankful to God that after his retirement age, he could continue the pulpit ministry to utilise whatever strength he has to edify the members. He is also thankful to the Singapore church to accept his participation in just pulpit ministry. In the beginning, some objected or were displeased to accept [though they did not object]. 

There were few occasions where he tendered his resignation to pulpit ministry but the church discussed and allowed him to continue. A deacon spoke to him, “You have already put yourself in the best position. You have spoken of a comparison before: there is a king with only one eye. He asked an artist to make a drawing of him. The artist drew a portrait portraying him as magnificent with both bright eyes. The king was displeased, “Everyone knows that I have only one eye.” 

Then he hired another artist and the artist drew him with only one eye and it resembled him closely, but the king was unhappy, “Why did you draw me so ugly and close to my looks?” 

How should he have been drawn then? Later on, an artist did a portrait of him and it pleased the king greatly. The artist drew a picture of him drawing the bow and arrow. As the king drew the arrow, he closed an eye. Amazingly, the artist was able to cover the weakness of the king’s one eye and made him look magnificent. The king was thankful to the artist as the artist was able to draw the king in such a position where you can see the king’s beautiful side.” 

All of us should put ourselves in the most correct position. If you’re able to put your position to do the right things for the right people, it’s the best. If you do the right things to the wrong people, you’ll only disappoint. The speaker thanks the Lord that he can assist in pulpit ministry for 21 years to date. In the past 25 years, he had undergone many difficult times and unpleasant experiences. After 25 years, for the next 21 years, the Lord gave him times of peace. This is the grace the Lord has given them. As Paul said in 2 Corinthians 2:4; 

'For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.'

We will meet with afflictions and at times the Lord may not take away our afflictions. He wants us to face the afflictions because this is a trial for us and He wants us to drink the bitter cup. But in afflictions, He comforts us so that we can bear these afflictions and trials. If not for God’s comfort, it would not be possible for the speaker to work up to today. 

Once the speaker was very disappointed and was about to give up. He was determined to give up his work. In his prayers, he told the Lord but was unable to utter any words. It was a very painful decision for him, so he knelt and couldn’t say anything and his heart was very sad, “I spent my entire life in church, am I going to end it here? I’ve endured so many hardships and difficulties, am I not going to endure further?” 

At that time, a sharp voice appeared in his heart, “Are you not able to endure with me?” The speaker remembered what the Lord told Peter in the garden of Gethsemane and could not hold back his tears. The speaker realised that he was like Peter and the tired disciples. But the Lord didn’t rebuke and just gave a reminder, “Are you not able to keep watch with me for an hour?” Through the comfort and encouragement of the Lord, he was able to continue. 

Although now he is afflicted with illnesses, he is still able to experience and taste the grace of God. When the clinical doctor said that he was suspected to have colon cancer, he asked for the history of his family members who had cancer. His father died of colon cancer, his sister of breast cancer and a few years ago his had brother lung cancer. Thankfully his brother is still alive. 

The doctor said, “Since your family has a history of cancer, it is likely you’re suffering from cancer too.” It’s estimated if 3 family members suffer from cancer, another family member has a 60% chance of having cancer. 

The doctor urged the speaker to go to the hospital to do a colonoscopy to determine if he had colon cancer. The doctor also urged him to go to a private hospital instead of a government hospital because there are already patients waiting to undergo this test. The speaker told him that his insurance didn’t cover private hospitals so he decided to wait. 

The speaker went to SGH, and after a week he was informed, “Mr. Chin, I’m sorry to inform you that we are unable to schedule a date for you because there are too many patients.” 

He asked, “Didn’t the clinic doctor already say it has to be an early appointment?” 

They replied, “No matter how early, the earliest is 1 month later.” 

The speaker told brother Sen Kee about this and he advised him to go to SKH, which is where he works. He arranged with his colleagues to arrange a colonoscopy, and thank God a week later, the speaker was able to undergo colonoscopy in SKH. When the speaker heard of this appointment he was happy although the doctor thought that he would be disappointed due to the waiting time. After the colonoscopy, the doctor told him, “Your tumour is large, and it could be cancerous.”

When the speaker heard this, his heart immediately sank. In his sermons, he mentioned that life can be unpredictable and in his sermons, he would use himself as examples such as, “Mr. Chin, this happened to you...”. As he related those examples, he would laugh. On that day when the doctor told him, “Mr. Chin...”, he was unable to smile. It was no longer an example but a reality that, “In me, there is a tumour.” He hoped it wasn’t cancerous but the doctor was suspicious of it and needed him to undergo an MRI and a CT scan to check how much the tumour has spread. 

To his knowledge, the procedure after discovering a tumour is that they would do a biopsy to check if it’s cancerous. If it’s cancerous, the next concern is that you’d have to undergo an MRI and a CT scan to determine the spread of cancer. When the doctor saw the tumour, he requested a biopsy test and immediately told the speaker he had to go for an MRI and a CT scan. This made him even more worried. He thought, “To undergo these tests, how long do I have to wait? If I had the money, I’d be able to go to the private hospital to wait less long.” 

It was beyond his expectations that the doctor arranged for the scans on the same day. The speaker heard the nurse talking to the personnel-in-charge, “I know you’re already very full, but the doctor insists to be done on this patient today.” The discussion seemed to go nowhere. The nurse put down the phone and walked away. Not long later she came back, “Mr. Chin, you can do your MRI at 3pm but you have to wait till 7pm for your CT scan.” He was very happy to go for two scans on the same day. 

At 3pm he went for the MRI but shortly after he went for the CT scan. The nurse that pushed him down said to him, “Mr. Chin, you are truly lucky. On the same day, you underwent colonoscopy, MRI and CT scan. This can only happen on a blue moon.” The speaker replied, “Thank God and also your doctor.” The speaker didn’t know who was his doctor then. 

The nurse replied, “The one who did your colonoscopy is the professor and head of the department, that’s why he has the authority to make such arrangements.” 

The speaker thought that if he had money he could consult a professor and private doctor, but now he can see a professor and within the same day he underwent the tests without having to wait [and pay as much].

Another coincidence is that the doctor arranged for him to undergo colonoscopy in the afternoon but a day before he was called to go in the morning instead. Hence, the medicine he takes to clear his bowels also has to be changed. The speaker asked why and the person on the phone replied, “I don’t know, but isn’t it better to do it earlier so you can rest earlier?” The speaker didn’t think much, but now he realised that if it was done in the afternoon, it wouldn’t be possible for the MRI and a CT scan to be done on the same day. The speaker thanks God that though he suffers from sickness, he continues to experience grace from God. It’s like a bitter coffee with added sugar. 

The most touching grace the speaker received was our concerns and prayers. When members heard that he had a tumour and was suspected to be cancerous, while waiting for the reports, many members were earnest in encouraging. Many members sent messages to him and his family to comfort and encourage. Some said that they prayed to the point of tears and didn’t hope for him to leave so quickly. Some prayed that the speaker can continue speaking sermons to them. Some recorded hymns they sang to comfort him. Some made snippets of Bible verses, to use the word of God to comfort him. In his sufferings, they received much encouragement. This is the grace of God and he thanks all of us for our concern. The speaker knows that this is not because he’s very good but because he’s a worker of God. Although in the past he suffered because of the Lord’s work, now because of the Lord he received our concern and help. Truly, in this period of suffering, he is deeply comforted. 

From the results of the colonoscopy, the news wasn't good. At that time, he arranged to prepare for the worst. He thought, “If my cancer cells spread and I have to undergo chemotherapy, should I still speak on the pulpit if I’m bald?” He was thinking that he would say goodbye to us. There is peace in his heart but there was a sense of unwillingness to go. Many encouraged him not to be fearful. He wasn’t fearful but there were things he couldn’t bear to let go. 

The results of other tests showed that there weren’t cancerous cells. This result was something beyond expectations and he felt that he escaped from inevitable death. He had to die eventually, but not so fast. If one doesn’t die from cancer, one can die from a traffic accident anytime or in their sleep. Let us not think that only when you’re stricken with cancer will you face death on the doorstep. If we are afflicted with a serious illness, let us not be so sad about it. Our lives are in the hands of God and we entrust our life to God and live every day as a grace from God.

When the doctors suspected that his tumour was cancerous, he thought, “The tests already showed negative, why did they still suspect?” 

The doctor told him, “This is not just my personal view but a group of doctors discussed and decided to tell you this,” As they looked at the size of tumour and from his family history, they suspected that within the tumour were cancerous cells. They would cut away this tumour completely and would do a biopsy to determine if there were cancerous cells. They also explained that in the first biopsy, they took a few points but it wasn’t deep into the tumour. If the cancerous tumour is big enough, it’ll be able to be determined quickly. If the malignant cells just started, it’s not easy to detect. The doctor comforted the speaker and his family to not worry because even if there were cancerous cells, it’s just an early stage. Then, they’d have to do a major operation to remove the colon and the speaker would have to carry the bag for life.

On 6 November the speaker would undergo this operation to remove the tumour. Temporarily they’d give him a bag to prevent infection and after recovery, the bag can be removed. Regardless, please continue to pray for the speaker. On 5 November he would be hospitalised and undergo an operation on 6 November. The speaker would like to request prayers but there’s no need for visitation. Don’t just pray for him, but also for members suffering from cancer. 

The speaker has always prayed for people suffering from cancer because his father and sister passed away from cancer so he can empathise with them. Though, no matter how he tries to appreciate, there’s always a gap. Only when he has a tumour that is suspected to be cancerous, then he truly understood the mental pain. His unwillingness to go also became very intense. 

Our brethren who are healthy have to cherish our health. Sometimes when we’re healthy, we quarrel over small things. We say that we’re moody because we have things disturbing us. One day, if you’re ever afflicted with a terminal illness, your perception will change. You’ll treasure every minute and you’ll no longer worry about the small things in life to quarrel with people. That’ll be when you understand that the Lord is the most important because only He can give you inner peace. Money can buy you the best doctor and perhaps save some waiting time. With a good doctor, your chances of success are higher but wealth and doctors are unable to give you the inner peace within you. Then, you’ll treasure inner peace and comfort will be very important to you. What’s most important in our lives is to have the Lord Jesus. We must never leave the Lord Jesus, we must be zealous to draw near to him at all times. If you’re ill or not wealthy, it doesn’t matter. 

What matters is that you have the peace and the joy of the Lord with you at all times.
