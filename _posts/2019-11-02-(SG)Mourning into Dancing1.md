Mourning into Dancing 哀哭变为跳舞（一）

This title comes from Psa 30. 

Psa 30:11
This is a psalm of David. From the verse, we can see it was the Lord who caused him to turn from mourning into dancing. Donning sackcloth refers to a period of mourning but the Lord clothed him with gladness. Through the psalm, David praised the Lord for guiding him in his life. 

Both mourning and dancing are two extreme emotions. But there’re also times we weep but it’s not that we’re sad. Sometimes we laugh but it’s not because we’re joyful. There’re times we cry and laugh at the same time because we have a mixture of emotions towards a certain matter. 

What caused David to mourn? How did he turn it into dancing? In times of tribulations, David had the faith to rely on the Lord, and hadn’t lost his hope with regards to the Lord. How did he not lose hope? Because he knows the Lord is the only one who can help him. There’s no other salvation other than by Him. Because of his faith, he was able to change from mourning to dancing. 

If we were to reflect on the entire life of David, there were times David went from dancing to mourning. We hence can consider the transition from both sides. 

In matters where his dancing turned to mourning was because of tribulations the Lord gave him. This was sometimes because he had sinned. This was sometimes because he had done something right though. 

Eccl 3:4
The Preacher tells us that under heaven, we will experience different times. Even our emotions will have ups and downs. The reason why the Lord wants man to go through different times is to experience God, allowing man to know the importance of relying on the Lord. That’s why we will experience times of weeping and times of laughter in our lifetime. Whether we mourn or dance, the important thing is to do the right thing before God. If we do the right thing even though we go through mourning, we are still blessed. After all, blessed is he who mourns.

Why did David need to go through a period of mourning? 

A wise saying: when God wants to entrust an important task to man, he will allow him to go through a test to train up his character so he becomes strong and one with will; to equip him with things he was lacking. Very often man will correct himself when he realises his mistakes. There’re times we’re troubled by our own character but our minds are blocked and are unable to think clearly. But through this process, we’ll find that we are growing. 

David was a shepherd boy from young. His entire life is like a legend. 

1 Sam 18:6-7
When Israel was victorious, the people were full of joy. However even though there were women who welcomed David with dancing, their words incurred the wrath of King Saul. The dance of the women was the starting point of David’s mourning as Saul was jealous of David and started to think of ways to kill him. Henceforth, the dance led to David to have to run for his life. As he was fleeing from Saul, he went to the city of his enemies. To preserve his life, he had to feign madness. This is something very sad. He let his saliva drip all over his beard. There’re only two situations a man has saliva drip: (1) you’re sick, (2) you’re a child/mad. David’s acting was so convincing his enemies really thought he was mad. 

David had to flee from Saul for a decade. Then God led him to be king. Throughout the entire process, David remained righteous. He had the opportunity to kill Saul but didn’t. He entrusted it to the Lord. He could’ve taken things into his hands but he didn’t. So the Lord was pleased with whatever David had done. Truly, there’s a time for mourning and a time for dancing. God caused David to become king after years of fleeing - mourning into dancing. 

2 Sam 6:16
By this time, David had become the king of Israel (and had united the northern and southern kingdom). David knew he became king because of the grace of the Lord. To recognise this, he brought the ark of the covenant into the city. He danced before the Lord as a show of gratitude to the Lord, because he understood it was the Lord that turned his mourning into dancing. If not for the help of the Lord, he wouldn’t have been able to be dancing. 

We as Christians have received grace from God too. Do we often give thanks to Him? Of course there’s no need to dance now (as dancing was how the Israelites expressed their joy last time). 

The point the speaker wants to emphasise was that even though David was a king, that didn’t stop him from giving thanks to God. 

When we want to give thanks to God today, we need not express our thanksgiving through dancing like David, but have we expressed it in other ways?

Eph 5:19-20
A Christian should always sing hymns and give thanks/praise to the Lord. This is not without reason. Giving praise is a reminder for us; to remind us what kind of life we’re leading today. We shouldn’t walk as fools but redeem the time. Is our life living in accordance to the will of the Lord? Are we filled with the Holy Spirit, and do we have the spiritual joy in our hearts? 

Often we forget the salvation grace of the Lord rendering us un-watchful. 

In times of tribulations, David trusted in the Lord. But in times of peace, what happened? Dancing turned to mourning because David sinned. Many matters arose in his households that caused great sorrow. Just imagine your own children killing among themselves. Or having your own son trying to kill you. 

When a man is saved by the Lord, mourning can go to dancing but dancing can go to mourning too because of the foolishness of man. 

As Christians, remind ourselves not to look lightly on attending services, praying and reading the Bible. 

On the day David sinned with Bathsheba, he had slept till afternoon. In other words, he was living in good times. And in good times, just like our lives in Singapore, it is easy to fall. 

The speaker thinks David likely didn’t pray/talk to the Lord often at that time. A person who prays often to the Lord will be sensitive to sin. If a Christian comes to church often to listen to the word, the words of the Lord will be in his heart. Even when he’s about to sin, he’ll meditate about the words of the Lord. Today, do we esteem attending service, praying and singing hymns? A simple act is very important. 

When David wasn’t watchful, he sinned. 

As we pray before the Lord, will we think about sinning? As we meditate on the words of the Lord, will we think about sinning?

This is a reminder for us so that we don’t sin. 

Eph 6:17
Put on the armour of God. Pray in the spirit. Why? If a solider is not well equipped, he will die in war. Let us not look lightly upon attending service, reading the Bible and praying. 

Some Christians don’t know something they have committed is a sin. “Is it in the Bible?” They don’t even know what they’ve done has cost them their soul. 

Let us not be in a situation where dancing turns into mourning. 

Exo 15:20, 1-2
The people of Israel had crossed the Red Sea and were delivered. v20 records that Miriam the prophetess took the timbrel and the women danced with her. They had been slaves for 400 years. A slave doesn’t have tomorrow. What caused them to mourn? Pharaoh, afraid of how the Israelites were multiplying, commanded for all male babies to be killed. This was to eradicate an entire race by assimilating them (no males, females would have to marry the Egyptians). What caused them to mourn? Giving birth is supposed to be a joyous matter. But not so for the Hebrews then. The birth of a child is something joyous and gives you hope. But the death threat of Pharaoh looming over them have them much sorrow. When they had escaped from Egypt, they knew it was God who allowed them to dance. 

If we don’t have God in our future, our life is all vanity. Don’t think possessions will make us happy. The more possessions we have, the more we will mourn because we have more we can’t take with us when we die. It’s true that we may be able to dance while we enjoy worldly enjoyments now, but in the end when death comes, we will mourn. 

The Israelites rejoiced and danced because they didn’t imagine going from a state of hopelessness to great hope. 

We are able to triumph over death and enter the heavenly kingdom. Are we able to hang on to the end? Will we dance with joy to have received this? We need to dance because the Lord is king. As we live in this world, do we see Him as king?

Heb 13:15
Do you think it’s important for us to attend service and give praise to God? This is the fruit of our lips. Do we like to come before Him and praise Him? Will we give thanks and praise Him in our lives? Are we also to experience the same joy and dance like the Israelites when they were freed from slavery?

Some Christians feel like their faith is nothing and gradually become weak, just like the Israelites. 

Exo 32:19
Moses ascended the mountain for 40 days and nights. Because he took long to return, the people created a moulded image and celebrated. When Moses descended, he heard celebration and dancing. Not to the Lord but to satisfy their own desires. They overlooked the words of the Lord, where God had instructed them not to have any idols. They danced not to praise God but to worship the golden calf. 

This is a matter we Christians need to be careful of. The Israelites were very joyful in their dance. But when the judgement of the Lord came upon them, it was very sad that they were killed by the Lord. God wanted to give them salvation. But they didn’t want God but sin. They wanted to satisfy their fleshly desires and lost their lives. As Christians we need to be careful lest our dancing turns into mourning. 

Acts 3:8
John and Peter went to the temple to pray. A lame man asked them for alms. Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have but in the name of Jesus, stand up and walk.” Peter gave him the most precious gift - Jesus. When a Christian has received grace, he needs to rise up and not be a spiritual lame. Many Christians are spiritually lame. After receiving grace, they aren’t able to stand in faith. This lame man entered the temple walking, leaping and praising God. People who’re lame aren’t able to enter the temple. We too weren’t able to draw near to God. But now that we can, do we likewise stand up in our faith, to praise God? To go to church for service and praise Him so others can see?

God has changed our mourning into dancing. Will we praise Him? In good times or times of tribulations, tell ourselves, “I want to come to church for service! I want to praise the Lord!” Bear the fruit of our lips and testify of the grace of God in our lives. In this time when faith grows cold, remind ourselves that our lives were originally without hope and full of mourning, but God has turned it into dancing. Remember this. Don’t submit to our desires. In times of weaknesses, hold fast to the fact that God will change our mourning into dancing.
