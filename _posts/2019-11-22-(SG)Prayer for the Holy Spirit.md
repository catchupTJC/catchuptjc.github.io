We turn to Romans 8:26-28; 

26 'Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  
27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. '

Receiving the Holy Spirit is the guarantee of the inheritance of heaven but it’s not merely a guarantee; we’ll receive power through the Holy Spirit to speak the word of God. On the last day, the Holy Spirit will also turn our bodies into spiritual bodies. Paul also speaks about this in Romans. 

But in our weaknesses, we may be sorrowful and don’t know how to pray; we may have the heart to do so but we don’t have the strength. The more we pray, the more we feel that God is far, that He doesn’t care. This is not the case. 

Here tells us that the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us  We may be very uncomfortable and groaning in our hearts, but the spirit makes intercession for us at our weakest point. Why is it that we’re comforted as we pray? It’s because God is working through the Holy Spirit to help us. This is why the Holy Spirit is so precious to us; the Holy Spirit prays for us when we don’t know how to pray. V27; 

Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. 

You may have prayed for a long time and you feel like giving up; the more you pray, the further away you are from receiving the answer. Many times we’re unwilling to submit to the spirit of God but when you submit to the spirit, you are more and more able to submit to Him because you’re praying in the spirit; you can understand the will of God. Slowly, in prayer, the Holy Spirit is slowly moulding and figuring you and you’ll have more experience in your prayer, “No one can understand my sorrows, but God knows.” The more you pray, the more you understand  the will of God. 

V28;  
And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. '

All things work together for good FOR THOSE WHO LOVE GOD. Who are those who love God? You may be in good or bad circumstances but you still continue to believe that God’s will is the best, “Even though I may not have my prayers answered yet, but at this moment I’m still willing to submit to God because I love God. Because I love God, I’m willing to ACCEPT HIS TEACHINGS. No matter my circumstances, I know that God will allow things to work together for MY GOOD. I won’t be more sorrowful the more I pray but as I pray through the Holy Spirit, He will allow me to more and more understand His will. No matter what circumstances I encounter, I’ll still believe His will is the best. I’m willing to be edified by my prayer. I’m willing to pray and have a spiritual communion with God.”

This is what we should be pursued and how we can be filled by the Holy Spirit. We can enjoy this intimate spiritual communion with God; it’s beautiful and it’s truly sweet. If you want to experience it, PRAY.
