Some of us may wonder why we need to offer during spiritual meeting. Is it for the SM expenses? 

We make offerings as a form of thanksgiving. 

We turn to Psalm 116:12, 

'What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me?'

17;

'I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord .'

Over the last few days we’ve heard many beautiful sermons, testimonies and had many prayers. All these allow us to reflect on our faith and know the state of our faith; how close and far we are away from God. 

Spiritual meetings are also for us to reflect on our journey of faith; are we still walking steadily towards the kingdom of heaven? We know the end of age is at end. Are we walking towards the kingdom of heaven, or have we taken a detour of our faith, or are we wandering in the wilderness? The SM is for us to reflect our service to the Lord. Over the last year, have we loved God more or have we lost our love for Him? Have we been zealous? The SM is a good time for us to count our blessings, grace, as well as the providence and guidance He gave us. We may have gone through hardships and troubles, but God was with us and were able to come attend this SM together. 

God has also comforted us when we’ve met with dejections, loss and failure. The love of God has never left us and God has been showering His grace and blessings upon us. Just as what was mentioned in v17; 

'I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord .'

The offering sessions in the SM are great opportunities for us to offer to Him for His great grace and love He showered upon us. It’s also a good time to make a resolution in our faith to continue calling His name, to improve our life of faith, to love and to serve God with all our souls, hearts and minds. We know that this offering session is for thanksgiving but we may wonder what the church uses this money for. 

The money collected for this SM is for the Singapore Collaboration Board (SCB). It’s for SM expenses as well but the rest is used to finance the activities of SCB, including the salary of preachers and FT workers’ salary, the training courses we attend, the SCB fellowship activities such as campus fellowship as well as the church’s development in Singapore. It’s very important we offer to these church works. As the Singapore churches journey towards the centennial, we continue to be able to develop the church and glorify the name of the Lord. 

May the Lord continue to help the churches in Singapore.
