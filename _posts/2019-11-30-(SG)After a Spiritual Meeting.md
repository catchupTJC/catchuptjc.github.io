Our Spiritual Meeting just ended. Have we received any benefit? This is one question we need to ask ourselves: did I receive anything? Am I more charged up and strengthened?

The church arranged Spiritual Meeting to renew our strength, which we need because we are weak in flesh, because we have mundane things to take care of. 

In the world there’re quite a number of instruments that need to be refocused or recalibrated. It seems like it’s the same with ourselves. After a while, we need to sit back, out aside the things of the world and realign ourselves with the things of God. Sadly, some things in our life becomes mere routine. Our daily prayers and Bible Reading. Even our monthly Holy Communion. In certain places they have 2-4 Holy Communion sacraments a year. But in Singapore we have at least 12. Every month we have one. We have two baptisms where we also have the Holy Communion. It’s true that sometimes routine takes away the freshness and our excitement. 

Some people feel we have too many prayer sessions and laying on of hands. But if we were to pay attention in each and every prayer session, and treasure the opportunity to receive the laying on of hands, then it will not be mere routine. 

We only have 2 Spiritual Meeting a year, but some already find it a routine. Some won’t take leave to attend Friday. The attendance on Sabbath day is slightly more than that on Sunday. “Because after all if I miss this Holy Communion I’ll be able to partake it in the next month’s one.” So people don’t attach a special significance to Holy Communion within a Spiritual Meeting. 

We have had a Spiritual Meeting a week ago. Did we receive anything from God?

If we had full attendance but it’s just a matter of habit, then perhaps we would not have receive anything much. 

Our spirit of attending sermons, our spirit in prayer, will decide very much how much we truly receive from God. 

Increasingly we see people talking when a sermon is spoken. Now the speaker seems not to realise this very much. In the past it caught his attention very much which affected his delivery of the sermon. But now it seems he naturally has this blindspot and he doesn’t really notice anymore. But people tell him that people are speaking during sermons, in the Spiritual Meeting. This is something that reflects our reverence for God. 

It’s the same with prayer. When he lays hands, he sees people taking from beginning to end. Our reverence at church attendance will decide very much how much God will bless us. The speaker (a preacher) also says ministers ought to reflect on themselves also - how much preparation is done for their sermons? Are they also exemplary in their attendance of services? And whether they take the effort to advise people when they talk unnecessarily.

1 Sam 3:1
The boy Samuel grew up and ministered to the Lord during a time when the word of the Lord was not widespread. Because God didn’t come near Eli the priest to reveal His word much. So when there’s no widespread revelation, very little of God’s word go down to the masses, and the people suffer. They don’t have enough spiritual food, spiritual guidance, so the faith of the people of Israel at that time is very weak. God was very far away. This is something we must pay attention to if we want to be blessed as a church. The church must be full of the word of God. It doesn’t mean we have the word of the Lord if we attend a lot of services and hear many sermons. There were many priests, including Eli around at that time. The worship of God continued. Every year, there were devout people like the family of Hannah. Her husband brought the entire family every year all the way to the tabernacle to worship. But the word of the Lord was so scarce in those days. 

So we need to ask ourselves - ministers need to examine themselves. Whether they study the word of God enough. Whether they study the word of God on a regular basis. When they do their visiting, counselling people, do they still set aside time to study the word of God, to spiritually nurture, to pray? When they write their sermons, do they just write to get by? Or do they really look into the needs of the people. Pray that whatever they deliver truly touches the hearts. 

For listeners, when the word of God is read, we also need to ask this question: is it really God is silent or are we not listening? God may be speaking through the sermon speakers, but we’re not listening. Because even in the days when Samuel grew up, remember when Hannah was praying, what happened? God heard her prayer and she also knew that she should give Samuel back to God as a servant. Look at 1 Sam 2 - Hannah’s Prayer was an inspired prayer. She didn’t need to listen to a sermon from Eli. She had a direct relationship with God. And look at her prayer. It was prophetic! She was like a prophetess. 

1 Sam 2:8
“He raises the poor from the dusting and lifts the beggar from the ash heap, to set them among princes and make them inherit the throne of glory.”
What is the throne of glory? At that time was the period of judges. There was no physical human king on the throne of Israel. When Hannah gave thanks and praise to God for a son, she suddenly became prophetic.

1 Sam 2:10
This is part of Hannah’s prayer:
“The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces; From heaven He will thunder against them. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth. “He will give strength to His king, And exalt the horn of His anointed.””

It’s interesting that Hannah’s son was the one who ordained the first kings of Israel - Saul and David. She prophesied Israel would have a king - anointed - Messiah. The word of God came from an ordinary woman Hannah!

There are some Spiritual Meeting where there’s a lot of discussion after the services. People talk about it during meal times or some days after because it was so edifying. 

Did we find the recent Spiritual Meeting edifying? Or boring where we can’t even remember the main theme?

Whatever the case, we need to get back and examine ourselves. There was a Spiritual Meeting organised by the church. But did I receive anything from God? It’s good to take stock of what we have received. And if we have not then we need to ask ourselves: is God silent or am I not listening?

Matt 13:9
The same is repeated in Rev 2:7. In Matthew, Jesus gave a simple remark that after what He said, those who have ears should hear. It’s such a blessing to hear directly from the Lord. Yet Jesus needed to remind people he who has an ear should hear. Because Jesus had His fair share of scoffers in His time. The words of Jesus are written for our benefit. We read His teachings and reminders. He who has an ear, hear. In revelation, Jesus had already resurrected and ascended. But He appeared in a vision and He says he who has an ear, hear. He who overcomes, I will let him eat of the fruit from the tree of life. In other words, hearing the word of God is challenging because we’re in the midst of challenges. There’re many things that constitute our spiritual enemies. If we don’t treasure the word of God, if we don’t fear when we haven’t heard the word of God for a long time, if we realise we didn’t receive anything during the Spiritual Meeting and don't fear, then we’re in a seriously dangerous situation. We need to be overcomers, victors. Then we can have a share in the tree of life. The word of God is our life. This is something we always need to remind ourselves. We can’t live without the word of God. 

There are different levels of hearing. Some of us hear nothing. Some of us hear with our head and understand. Some of us the word of God doesn’t just go into our heads and stays at the level of understanding, it cuts into our hearts. We’re emotionally moved and motivated, and spring into action. 

Recently there’s a poll where women say their pets are better listeners than their husbands. The speaker also heard from a couple “my wife listens to every word I say. But I admit sometimes when my wife talks I don’t listen to everything.” Sometimes the speaker’s wife asks him, “Did you hear what I said?” And he’ll “oh oh oh!”

The speaker doesn’t know why males seem to have more auditory filters than women. And doesn’t know why women say their pets are better listeners when they don’t even understand. Since listening to others is important, all the more listening to God is of utmost importance. 

God said something similar to the women about their pets.
“The ox and donkey know their owners but my people don’t.”
Let’s not insult ourselves and allow it to be so that beasts/animals respond better than we to God our Master. 

It’s easy for us in human weakness to choose speakers. Some look at the schedule to see which speaker is speaking and choose the church to go since Singapore is so small anyways. They want to eat fresh grass, they don’t want hay. They don’t mind listening to the same preacher again. They don’t want to listen to some.  

Matt 23:1-3
The scribes and Pharisees were the religious leaders in those times. Much as Jesus criticised them, and even reprimanded them to their face, but His advice to the multitudes is this: whatever they tell you to do, listen. They still had to listen because that was the situation then. And the scribes and Pharisees weren’t good teachers. When the people heard Jesus they marvelled at His teaching, because He taught with authority, not like the scribes and Pharisees. Of course it’s also because they didn’t practice what the preached and only talked. But Jesus still said to listen to what they said. 

Today we sit in the church and listen to speakers. The speaker hopes we don’t equate them to scribes and Pharisees. At most they speak poorly or don’t prepare adequately. The very least we can do is to not talk during sermon. Don’t tell yourself “so boring I don’t want to come to church”. There’s still something we can glean. Be an active listener. If he’s boring, entertain yourself. With your current Bible knowledge, you can still work on the sermon and more things can come about. We may think “oh no la I’m not a preacher or haven’t attended RE lesson before”. But look at Hannah. She didn’t have the Bible we have today nor even the Old Testament (she herself was story written into the Old Testament). There was only the first 5 Books of Moses at that time and she didn’t have a copy which was very expensive. What she had was what she had heard but it worked in her a certain level of faith. Allowed her to pray such a wonderful and inspired prayer. 

Every single one of us here is in a more privileged situation. We avoid prejudice and listen to every speaker. But we of course we don’t go to the other extent to have undue reverence for certain speakers. Have reverence for God.

1 Cor 3:5-6
We shouldn’t privilege Paul over Apollos or Barnabas, etc. 

The Spiritual Meeting is already over. If we had paid attention to all sermons, the speaker is sure we would have gotten something from each sermon. If we haven’t, it’s not over. Ask ourselves if we’ve gotten anything from it and reflect on it. 

Listen to sermons with this attitude: as long as the person on the pulpit speaks the word of God, listen. Run it in our heads and we’ll realise we gain more than what’s spoken. 

Don’t just hear the voice on the pulpit. Learn to ask the Lord to speak to us. 

If we don’t feel charged up after the Spiritual Meeting, it’s quite sad we’re not energised. 

1 Sam 3:1
There’s no widespread revelation at that time. But in v10, it’s not that God didn’t want to speak but that the people didn’t listen. Is God silent or are we not listening? It’s because Eli and his sons weren’t listening. And Samuel was too young. But God did not despise youth. He went to speak to Samuel twice. “Samuel Samuel.” Samuel didn’t immediately recognise it was God’s voice. Twice he went to Eli if he called for him. But the third time God called, Samuel said, “Speak for I am listening.” Why? Because Eli told him it’s God and to say, “Speak for I am listening.” Eli was one who didn’t speak the word of God to people. He hadn’t heard God’s voice for a long long time. But it was the same Eli who told Samuel to say speak for your servant listens. So anyone who stands on the pulpit will still be able to say something to you and open your ears to God. Like Samuel who later became a prophet well known (3:20). Why? Because Samuel’s words never fell to the ground (3:19).

The word of God became abundant in Samuel. 3:21 God appeared to Samuel again in Shiloh. 

Today we live in an age God doesn’t choose to just speak to designated prophets or certain kings or to very rare people like Hannah.

Today we live in the last days, where God will pour His Spirit on all flesh. All of us will be able to receive God’s word. The Bible is already complete. We pray for the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit’s fullness, to open our eyes, open up the Scriptures and God will speak to you. Speak and your servant is listening. 

While we listen to sermons, get a few ideas we can work on. And then look into those verses in the Bible. Look at what the surrounding verse say. Even look at the concordance or verses that says the same thing. Do your own Bible study. 

Firstly, after a Spiritual Meeting, we need to ensure we move on with renewed strength. If we’re not charged up, don’t just hear the voice on the pulpit, discern the word of God. Study into it. The word of God is alive. It’ll surely energise you. 

Secondly, pray for the speaker. Even when you’re speaking there and you find him confusing or dry, say a silent prayer in your heart. The speaker of this sermon said he would appreciate it very much if we did it for him. 

Eph 6:19-20
Even Paul, a powerful evangelist in word and writing, asked for prayer. We need to pray for all our sermon speakers and preachers so the word they speak is edifying and will bring life to the church. 

2 Chron 30:5-8
King Hezekiah tried to revive the faith of Judah. He managed to motivate them to keep the Passover. v10-13 tells us it was a long time after non-observance. He even sent messengers to the north to ask people to come down to join them. There was a successful celebration of a feast in Jerusalem. 

2 Chron 30:26-27
They knew their prayer went up to the very dwelling place of God. That was the kind of closeness they knew they achieved. How nice would it be if our Spiritual Meeting is like that. And after the Spiritual convocation, this Passover, there was some post convocation actions in chapter 31. A lot of reforms took place. v1 they cleared out the idols! v2-3 they restored the ministry of the priesthood and Levites. So after the Spiritual Meeting, we should be able to abandon things that hinder our worship of God like getting rid of idols. We should also be renewed in zeal or renew ministries that have not been done in a while. At the end of it, they also offered. We too should offer after the Spiritual Meeting, not just in terms of money. 

So we can still make our Spiritual Meeting a success! We can’t wind back the clock to last week Spiritual Meeting, but we can still allow ourselves to be charged up from here on out.

Will you allow God to work in you?
