We turn to Job 1:1;

'There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. '

Here we see how the Bible introduces Job. God said this twice in v8 when the Lord asked Satan; 

'Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”'

Here the Lord describes Job as someone who loves God. After one of the trials by Satan in Job 2:3; 

'Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”'

After going through one trial by Satan, the Lord reassured that Job is someone who fears God. 

Then his friends had a debate with him. One of his friends, Eliphaz, knew Job well. In Job 4:6; 

'Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?'

His friends also knew of his fear for God and how he relied on God. Through how the Bible introduces him, God’s words and his friends, we know that Job fears God. The book of James also tells us that the endurance of Job is something we should learn from. 

Job’s faith was very firm especially when he went through two trials by Satan; he was able to stand firm and hold on to his faith. The foundation of his faith was very firm. 

Let us see how Job was able to ground his faith so firmly today as mutual encouragement. We read Job 1:9-11;

9 'So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 
10 Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 
11 But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”'

Here is Satan’s reply to Job. When the Lord told Satan that Job was someone who feared God and shunned evil, Satan answered, “Does Job fear God for nothing?” He was suggesting there is a purpose why Job was holding on to his faith; because God has protected Job very fully. V10 says, “a hedge around him”. Under the protection of God, there was no way harm could come upon him. 

Not only that, he was also greatly blessed by God. The works of his hands have been blessed and his possessions have increased in the land. So Satan was saying, “Because You treated and protected him so well, of course he will fear You and listen to You! But if You take away everything he has and not protect him anymore and take down this hedge to attack; all that he has You take back. Then, he will abandon You and no longer fear You.” In v12, God told Satan; 

'And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person. ” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord .'

“Since you think that there’s a purpose why Job has this religion, I’ll let you test him. All that he has is in your power but you cannot lay your hand on this power.” Satan had the opportunity to protect Job and he didn’t spare any mercy to him and destroy all that he had. 

Job 1:13-19; 

13 'Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house; 
14 and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
15 when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” 
16 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” 
17 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” 
18 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
19 and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”'

In one day, Job lost all his livestock. Also in a day, he lost all his children. All these disasters came upon Job one after another. The devil was truly merciless in dealing with Job. Was Satan’s suggestion correct after all these things happened? 

In v20; 

'Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. '

When Job met with this disaster, he lost all his possessions. He believed that this was God’s will. 

“Naked I came from my mother’s womb, naked I return there.” 

No one can deny this concept. 

However for him to be able to say this when he was losing everything shows his faith. He knew that both the power to give and take away is in God’s hands. In all these, neither did Job sin nor charge God with wrong. 

If Job built his faith in all these material things and protection, with this attack from Satan, Job would have failed. Whatever Satan predicted about Job would have been correct. 

We have to be very sure what our faith is built on. Otherwise, if a disaster befalls us, we may lose our faith. We turn to 1 Thessalonians 3:3-4; 

3 'that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. 
4 For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know. '

Paul sent Timothy to visit the believers in Thessalonica because Paul was suffering persecution and he had to leave Thessalonica. The church began to grow there and these believers were first generation. Paul was worried if these new believers would lose their faith when faced with tribulations and quickly sent Timothy to them. 

Timothy came back with good news in v6;

'But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also to see you— '

Paul wrote a letter to encourage the believers that we were appointed to suffer tribulation. When Paul was there, he had already told the believers that this road is not the easiest to walk and you mustn’t have a too idealistic image of it. It’s like we’re writing many cheques on behalf of God, “God will heal you”, “God will protect you” on behalf of God. Then after the person believes, they’ll say God didn’t keep His promise. This is building our faith on things physical. If we experience this, we might think that this religion was a mistake. 

Many build their faith on things material on or wealth. During CNY, the Chinese will worship the god of fortune because they believe that it’s a new year so they want to receive a great amount of money for the new year. They want to worship the god of fortune for good fortune. They do so hoping that they’d make a lot of money and good possessions. 

What if it doesn’t happen? They’ll go to their god and complain about it, “You didn’t let me earn money, so I’ll break your head!” 

You’ll end up seeing many statues without heads because these gods didn’t give the believers what they want. This is the kind of faith mna has. They treat their god like a bank, “You are my god so you’re supposed to give me a chance to earn great fortune and protect me from all harm.” If you worship God in this manner, you’re exploiting and controlling Him. This is a wrong attitude towards your faith. When you meet with tribulations, your initial motive of worshipping God will be revealed. 

Job’s faith was not built upon these material things of the world. We turn to Job 2:3;

'Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”'

After Satan’s first attack and trial, things didn’t go according to Satan’s prediction and Job held on to his faith. 

For no reason, Job suffered this calamity but he still held on to his integrity. But Satan didn’t give up; he always looks for the opportunity to attack us. 

Now, he came up with his second trial in v4; 

'So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. '

“Wealth is not one’s life. If you’re still living, you can still work hard even though he lost all his children. If now he’s the one suffering, this may be a crisis.” 

In v6, the Lord said to Satan; 

'And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.”'

Satan attacked Job for a second time and painful boils struck Job. Here Job was sitting in the midst of ashes; a place where people are abandoned. If you’re suffering from diseases like boils and leprosy, you cannot live alongside other people. Job took for himself a potsherd and separated himself from others. 

In v9; 

'Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”'

This is exactly what Satan wanted Job to say, “Curse God, give Him up and die!” 

His wife was telling him what Satan wanted Job to do. If his faith was built on his wife, he’d have lost his faith. 

If our faith is built on other people, these people may be caught up in Satan’s plan. What comes out from their mouth may be from men but he may say words that Satan wants him to say. So Job’s wife said her words but they’re the intent of the devil, “Why are you still holding on to your faith? You worship this God and yet you have no peace and health! Why do you still worship Him? This is also a crisis of one’s faith. If we build our faith on other people, we may be easily influenced by them.

There was once in a meeting on purchasing a plot of land to build a church. The church was too small and there was a lack of space. It was also not sufficient to receive guests. There were suggestions for a bigger plot of land to build a bigger church to receive more guests to aid in church work. 

There was someone who saw that everyone was talking about the church and he took the opportunity to express his discontent in church. There was someone who was listening and was so frustrated. He said, “If you don’t like it so much here, just leave!” The speaker was shocked. This person who was airing his complaints left when he heard this. The speaker thought, “Oh no, another person to visit.” He was very worried, “Although everyone has their own views but to express them with such anger isn’t very good.” 

The next day during service, the brother who left the meeting came to church. He left in anger the other day but he came for service. He didn’t choose to not attend service because of this reason. The speaker was worried and talked to him. He replied, “It’s him who asked me to not come, why should I listen to him? Why should I listen to his instructions?” 

This is right; who can tell us not to worship God? Although there are some unpleasant things happening in church, it shouldn’t keep you from coming to church, “Whether or not I come to church because of people, my faith is on God and not on men.” This is a firm and stable faith. 

Satan attacked Job’s health. If Job has built his faith upon his health or things of this earth, his faith would have suffered a great hit. We turn to 2 Corinthians 12:7; 

'And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. '

In the same way Satan dealt with Job, he did the same to Paul. He attacked his physical health and there was a thorn in the flesh given to Paul. If this was of a great bother to Job and Paul, their faith would have suffered a great hit. But Paul was very clear that this was an attack given by Satan, “He knows my weaknesses and is attacking my weaknesses.” Hence Paul prayed to God for strength. 

When Jesus was preaching the gospel, He met a person blind from birth. The disciples asked Jesus, “Who has sinned, is it him or his parents?” Jesus replied, “None, but that the power of God may be seen on this man.” 

Another time, Lazarus, whom the Lord loved, was sick. Someone told Jesus about it. Jesus replied, “This sickness is not unto death but to show the glory of God.” 

When we’re in times of sickness, it’s a time for God to show His glory and power. We won’t always be healthy. Those things unbelievers experience, we’ll also experience. The difference is that when we experience these things, we have God on our side. We should remind ourselves to look for God. When everything is fine, we won’t look for God. But when you’re unwell and sick, you feel uncomfortable and would want to look for a way to get better. But after you look for all means, what’s next? Some wait to die; the end of their sickness will be just death. But this is the critical time to live out our faith; to be able to feel God’s grace in our sicknesses. 

Paul prayed about this thorn in his flesh and God’s grace was revealed to him. God said, “My grace is sufficient for you.” In Paul’s sickness, it was a great encouragement. 

It’s like someone drowning in the ocean asking for help. Then, someone suddenly throws a lifeline to this person. This person would then grab on it because his life depends on it. If he loses this lifeline, he’d die. If he holds on to this lifeline, he’d be able to go through this tribulation. 

In our sicknesses, only God can help us. Then you’ll discover that your prayers will be more fervent and you’ll feel that God’s grace is really sufficient for you and your faith will be even stronger. 

Job was able to overcome both attacks by Satan and the foundation of his faith was still unshaken. This shows that his faith was not built on material things, men or a transactional relationship. Otherwise, his wife’s words would have shook him. It also wasn’t built on a desire for peace and health. His faith was built on God. 

Only when our faith is built on this rock, we’ll be able to go through all tribulations. May God help us.
