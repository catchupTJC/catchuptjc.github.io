What are the two questions in life we have to think deeper about?

Acts 22:6-10  
This is the testimony of a disciple  
On the way to the city of Damascus, he met the Lord of life. A bright light from heaven shone upon him and a voice said, “Saul, Saul, why’re you persecuting Me?” In response, Saul asked two questions. 

1. Who are you, Lord? (v8)  
2. What shall I do, Lord? (v10)

These are also two questions we would like to examine. Through Saul who came to know the Lord Jesus, let us likewise come to know the God of heaven. We will look at his personal experience and testimony. 

The two questions are commonly asked by us. For example when we pick up a call, we’d ask the caller, “Who are you?” and even ask, “Why’re you looking for me?” 

Likewise when Saul was called by name, he asked back, “Who are you?” The voice from heaven answered back clearly, “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.” This gave Saul a clear understanding of who the Lord is. Through this self introduction, let us get to know God better. 

God is Jesus of Nazareth. Nazareth is a small town in the northern part of Israel. Jesus had a disciple by the name of Nathaniel. When he heard about Jesus, he said, “What good can come out from Nazareth?” The people at that time didn’t see Nazareth as a big, bustling city. 

Matt 2:23  
Jesus grew up in Nazareth that what the prophets had spoken about in the past might be fulfilled “He shall be called a Nazarene”. Many prophets before Jesus was even born prophesied that He would be born in Nazareth. Being able to know where a person will be born is amazing. But God appoints the days and times of men. There’re many decisions and choices we can make. But there’re two that we can’t. 

Matt 1:22-23  
Before the Lord Jesus was born, there was a prophet named Isaiah who prophesied in 700BCE. He prophesied of the birth of the Lord Jesus whose name would be Immanuel (meaning: God with us). God wants to dwell with us, and wants to manifest Himself to us. Jesus of Nazareth is the God of heaven, and this God of heaven has been born on earth to dwell WITH men. Only through the manifestation of the Lord Jesus in the flesh are we able to get to know God. We think getting to know God is simple. But when we have problems and want to find God, is it really that simple? The reality is that if not through the self-manifestation of God, it’ll be hard to find Him. 

Jesus of Nazareth is the true God that has manifested Himself to dwell with men. This means that to find God, it’ll be easy to do so through the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The speaker is from Taiwan and has stayed in Singapore for more than 4 years. When he revisits the places he’s gone before, they’re familiar and brings back many memories. When he’s in Taiwan and he hears people speaking Singlish, it’ll bring fond memories to him. When he hears talk about Singapore, he’ll also draw closer, wanting to know more. 

This God in heaven has once dwelt on earth, and lived with mankind. People also came to get to know Jesus and bore testimony of Him. Jesus of Nazareth wants to dwell with men. 

Matt 1:20-21, 24  
The purpose Jesus has come on earth is to save people from their sins. Before he was born, an angel told his father that his name was to be called Jesus (meaning: Saviour). 

How will Jesus deliver people from sin?  
Acts 2:22-24  
Peter was speaking a sermon about who Jesus was.  
“Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst”

People in illness and in need of help were healed by Jesus, and this was witnessed by the congregation Peter was speaking to. 

Man’s strength is limited but the Lord’s strength is limitless. Through these miracles, signs and wonders, Jesus proved He was God Himself. 

How did He deliver His people from sins? Although He was guiltless, He was nailed on the cross for all of us. No matter how good a man is, he wouldn’t die for someone he didn’t know. And God raised Him up; He was not constrained by death. Only the God of life can gain victory over death. 

To understand and experience the love of God, it can’t be through the words of speakers on a pulpit, but through the Spirit of God that’ll move you. 

Acts 3:6  
A lame man was able to leap up and stand in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. There’re many such testimonies of miracles in the True Jesus Church. Sister Liu in Taiwan was invited by a classmate to the True Jesus Church when she was 17 years old. At the end of the service, there was a prayer for the Holy Spirit. To experience God, we must receive the spirit of God. The True Jesus Church sister who invited Sis Liu prayed that her friend would be able to experience God. She received the Holy Spirit! She went home to tell her mother who got very angry and forbid her from coming to church. She didn’t come for 2 decades. After graduating and getting married and in labour, her child died at birth. She expected to hold a newborn in her arms, but received a stillborn instead. Later her aged parent contracted cancer and passed half a year after contraction. When she was most helpless, her closest family members left her. That was when she thought of church. 24 years had passed and then she came back. She was 40 over years old then already. She confessed her sins to God. She prayed to the God who gave her the Holy Spirit when she was 17. She asked, “God are You still willing to give me the Holy Spirit?” She thought of all her wrongs and then thought she wasn’t worthy of asking this. As she thought this, she once again received the Holy Spirit she received when she was 17. She felt like she was home again. She had left the Lord for so long but now she was home again. She was determined to get baptised no matter what objections. After baptism, she  In July 1999, she was doing house chores and suddenly felt unwell. She felt a sharp pain in her spine, as if someone was driving a nail in. She was in such excruciating pain, she fell to the ground and was unable to get up. Her family rushed her to the hospital. The doctor examined her and said the lower section of her spine had degenerated; to resolve it a surgery was required. Even if the surgery was successful, she’d need a spinal brace for the rest of her life. If it failed, she may be disabled for life. She finally still decided to go for the operation. After the church learnt about this, members visited her in hospital. An old sister bore testimony that she had a problem with her eyes and needed to undergo surgery. She prayed, “God please help me that I don’t need to go through surgery and show Your power.” This gave the sister a lot of faith. Her mother who was still truthseeking at that time and had not believed then asked, “How is it the Jesus you believe in doesn’t help you?” She prayed that she would be able to bear testimony for God. She decided to rely on God and not undergo the surgery. Her husband told her not to act in this manner. She prayed and confessed her sins before God - all her shortcomings. Amazingly, the swell in her legs subsided. The pain she used to be in was so great that when someone brushed past her, it’ll be unbearable. She asked her husband to press her. He did and she said there was no pain. He didn’t believe her and pressed even harder. It really didn’t hurt! In just a moment, she was healed! And it was a great testimony to all her family members.

She bore testimony for the Lord Jesus in her illness. From the time she came to believe till the time she was ill, she clearly experienced Jesus and was able to witness the great power of God. 

This is the testimony of Sis Liu. The true God of heaven is Jesus of Nazareth. He wants to be with us and dwell with us. He wants to be our Saviour. May you have the opportunity to receive salvation grace.
