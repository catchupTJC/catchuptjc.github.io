Christian living is having the word of God being applied to our daily lives. Whether it’s the way we have recreation, work, think, treat other people (e.g. how you treat your employees if you’re an employer). All these things we do must be according to the Bible. 

Christian living begins with faith. If we don’t have faith in God, then we don’t believe the Bible contains the word of God. Then even though we are a highly disciplined person who does a lot of good, that isn’t practising Christian living. 

A Christian must keep the word of God, and the word of God in the Old Testament includes the command of the Lord, and the New Testament includes the teachings of the Lord Jesus. We do according to these words of God. We believe in one true God, therefore we worship Him and believe in Christ our Saviour. So we humble ourselves to confess our sins before Him. We will always repent and ask for forgiveness. We believe in the Lord as the righteous judge. Therefore we hope for the eternal reward in heaven and live a life of holiness and godliness. This is our faith in God. 

Faith must always be shown by works. 
Jas 2:19-26
Faith with works is emphasised on. This doesn’t contradict the teaching that we’re justified by faith. Faith must be manifested by works. Faith without works is like a body without a spirit, it’s dead. Even the devils believe but don’t have faith. Why did the devil tempt Jesus? He believes in the existence of God but His faith didn’t justify Him. Likewise when we say we believe in Christ today, we must show it by our works of faith performed according to the teachings of the Bible. This is how we live our lives as a Christian. We don’t only do so in deeds but also in establishing the values we have in life. So we have the word of God both outwardly and inwardly. This is Christian living. 

Christian living must include these 3 things:
1. Worship
2. Bible Reading 
3. Prayer
First is worship. If a person believes in Jesus Christ but doesn’t worship Him; doesn’t even kneel down to pray, go to church, obey or glorify Jesus Christ, surely his life is not that of a person living according to Christian living. Similarly with the second thing: daily Bible Reading, we always say the Bible is the word of God. The contents of the Bible are the spiritual food our soul needs. But if we don’t read the Bible, we will die of spiritual hunger. We won’t be able to be strong in faith. Our lives will be contrary to the word of God. Thirdly is prayer. A person who doesn’t pray doesn’t know what prayer means. In actuality, a person who prays regularly has a life that has the abidance of God. The peace of God rules his heart so that in this life of turmoil and trouble, he fountained to have peace and strength in the Lord, able to overcome many tribulations. Like Daniel who was thrown into the lion’s den. But he was a man of prayer. That very day, he prayed thrice, then he was cast in the lion’s den. The three times daily prayer was his custom. Not only that day, but everyday though he was a very busy man serving the king of Babylon/Persia, he still found time to pray. That was his faith and trust in God. So even when in the lion’s den, the Lord sent an angel to close the lions’ mouths. He wasn’t harmed not because the lions weren’t hungry but because the Lord was with him. This is our life of praying to God. These three things must definitely be found in our lives today. If God is our Creator, then let us worship Him. 

1. Worship
Rev 4:2-11
Elder John was in the spirit. He entered into a spiritual realm and saw a throne in heaven and one who sat on it which was God. It was the lamb of the Lord - Jesus Christ Himself. Around the throne was a rainbow which symbolises grace. When Noah came out of the ark after the flood, he and his family offered sacrifices to God. The smell of the sacrifice was pleasing to the Lord so God made a covenant with Noah that he wouldn’t destroy the world with a flood again and its sign was the rainbow. So the throne with the rainbow symbolises the grace of God. Around the throne were 24 thrones (v4) which sat 24 elders. The throne represents the church of God; the judgement seat of God is in the church; it’s also a throne of grace. The 24 elders also hold offices in the church of God. And there were 4 living creatures (v6) which represents the most spiritual believers - brave like lions, always serving like an ox/calf, have a human nature likened to God when Adam was created, flying high in the sky like an eagle who makes its nest in the high mountains indicating spiritual believers. Each living creature had 6 wings full of eyes around and within which means they’re full of wisdom. They know what’s happening around them and praise the Lord saying, “Holy Holy Holy.” When these 4 living creatures give honour and glory and thanks to God (v9), the 24 elders fell down before Him and cast their crowns before the throne. This symbolises the church’s worship of God. Spiritual leaders lead the worship and those who hold spiritual offices in church humbly lower themselves and cast their crowns saying, “You are worthy O Lord to receive all glory and honour for You crested all things and by Your will all things were created.”

Worship is honouring the Lord because He is most high. To Him belongs all glory and honour. In church while we keep the word of God, do a lot of good and love many people; leaders in the church make a lot of sacrifices, but when we worship God, we all humble ourselves before Him. This is worship. We worship because of the grace of God and not because of our righteousness. It’s by His mercy we’re able to come before His presence. Because we’re guilty of sin. If God were to mark our sins, who can stand before Him? Today we’re able to come before the Lord but we must humble ourselves when we come and worship Him. 

Rev 11:15-19
This was when the 7th angel sounded the 7th trumpet (last one). When the 7th trumpet is sounded, then 7 bowls will be poured out. So whether it’s the 7th seal, trumpet or bowl, that may refer to the Last Day. Her the 24 elders fells on their faces to worship God because righteous judgement has come and the Lord is worthy. He’s the one who was and is and is to come (v17) because He has taken His great power and reign. So He is the righteous judge. The wicked will be destroyed but those who fear Him - the saints and prophets - will be rewarded. The temple of God was open in heaven and the ark of God was seen in His temple. In the ark of the covenant was the two slabs of stone which shows the judgement will be according to the word of God. It is very righteous because the commandments of God have been proclaimed since the time of Moses. From the time of Jesus where the gospel of salvation was preached until now. So when judgement comes, we cannot deny that we do not know. Especially us who know the Lord and know what’s in the commandment of the Lord. His judgement will hence be very fair. There are those who totally deny the Lord, perhaps the unbelievers. But to those who believe, judgement will still be according to the word of the Lord. When we worship the Lord, we’re reminded God is king and that we’re saved by grace. That we’re able to be saved because of His mercy. Let’s not take it for granted. He shed His blood. Every drop bled was for our sins, and this blood continues to forgive our sins, provided we have faith in Him and are ready to obey His commandments. Submit to the word of God and His blood continues to be the sacrifice of sins. But if we presume on the lovingkindness of God, then we commit sin presumptuously and defy God. Judgement for us will be as great as those who defy Him. But God isn’t a God of wrath but a God of righteousness. He has mercy until the day of judgement. On that day, He’s a righteous judge. Those godly will be rewarded. That’s why we’re able to praise and worship Him, and why we continue our holy worship of the true God. And why we find it so necessary to come and pray and worship Him. 

The Jews obeyed and kept the Sabbath. Today we believers of Christ say we obey God but do we obey the commandments of Christ?

John 4:23-24
Jesus Christ tells us Himself how to worship Him. We should worship Him in spirit and truth. Spirit means sincerity from the heart. Truth means it must be according to the word of God. A person can be very true but may be disobeying the teachings of God. That’s not worshiping God in spirit and truth yet. That’s why we must search the Scriptures today, so we can accord holy and acceptable worship to Him. 

One big question is whether keeping Sabbath (7th day) is necessary. This is a question we must find out on our own. The 4th commandment is to keep the Sabbath. Before this, God had already established the Sabbath on the 7th day during creation. He hallowed that day. Jesus said Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. Then in Exodus, it was included in the 10 commandments. Because of that, those who violated the commandment, for example picking firewood during the Sabbath and not consecrating that day, would have the wrath of the Lord come upon them. For the case of the person who picked firewood on the Sabbath, God commanded for him to be stoned because he went against the commandment. 

Today not everybody thinks Sabbath keeping is important. But Jesus says if we want to enter into life, keep the commandments (i.e. the 10 commandments). After believing in Jesus, the apostles still went to the temple on the Sabbath. Not because they were Jews but because they were believers of Jesus and this was keeping the commandments. Today, our worship must be fully according to the commandment of God. Keeping the Sabbath is necessary. 

Isa 56:4-7
The Lord promises those who keep the Sabbath - even eunuchs, the foreigners willing to join the people of God to keep the commandment - will be brought to the holy mountain and made joyful in His house of prayer. Sacrifices and burnt offerings was how they kept the Sabbath then. Today, our keeping of Sabbath must be right. Keeping the Sabbath is a holy convocation, that’s why we always have to worship God on the Sabbath day in the house of the Lord. Coming for Sabbath service is not something optional. “I feel like going then I go. I don’t feel like going then I don’t go. I go tomorrow. I don’t need to go on the 7th day.” But Sabbath keeping is a commandment of the Lord. Of course we can worship God on any day but worshiping on the Sabbath is a commandment of the Lord.

2. Daily reading of the Bible 
a) The word of God makes us wise for salvation
When we read the gospels and Acts, we see Jesus entered into the synagogue in Luke 4 and given a scroll of Isaiah to read. 

Acts 13:14-15
In the synagogue of the Jews, especially on the Sabbath Day, there was the practice of reading the law and prophets. There was New Testament at that time, because the Scriptures only consisted of the Old Testament at that time. 

When Jesus read the scripture of Isaiah in the synagogue in Nazareth, He read a prophecy concerning Himself. 
Luke 4:18
Jesus said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel.” When He read this, He said, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” (v21). The Scriptures spoke of Christ and what He would undergo. This is the Old Testament. The New Testament tells us how Jesus fulfilled it. The Old Testament is like a plan and the New Testament is how Jesus fulfilled it. He fulfilled the prophecies and will fully fulfil what’s written in the Scriptures. That’s why when we read the Bible and have an understanding of the salvation of the Lord, our faith will be with understanding and direction. 

2 Tim 3:15-16
Timothy was taught the holy Scriptures from childhood by his mother and grandmother. The holy Scriptures made him wise for salvation. This was very important. It taught him how to be saved and God’s plan for salvation. There’re diverse beliefs today. Even in the Christian Faith, there’re thousands of explanations. Who’s right according to the Bible? You must be led by the holy Bible. Only when the Holy Spirit guides us and we read the Scriptures with the fear of God, then we’ll be guided to the plan of salvation grace. Otherwise we’d be very confused. So reading the Bible makes us wise for salvation. 

b) The word of God makes us aware of our flaws
Eph 5:26-27
God uses the word like washing water to sanctify the church. When we read the Scriptures, the word of God is like washing water. It makes us aware of our flaws and wrongdoings. It guides us to the knowledge of what’s right in the sight of God because the word of God sanctifies and leads us to what’s holy. This changes us. We ourselves may not notice but others may notice after some time that a person who reads the Bible has a change in his life to be very different from his past. A person who doesn’t change after many years of believing in Christ probably doesn’t read the Scriptures. He hears but doesn’t apply to his life. Reading the Bible thus has this benefit and we would do well to read it daily. 

c) The word of God is the sword of the spirit
Since we are fighting a spiritual war, we need the sword of the spirit. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, He used the word of God. 

Luke 4:4, 8, 12
This was how Jesus Christ overcame Satan (read verses). After 40 days of fasting, Satan came to tempt Him with the pride of life, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes. But Jesus Christ used the word of God to resist so that when the devil had ended every temptation (v13), Jesus Christ could overcome because He read the Scriptures. Today we read the Scriptures to equip ourselves to resist temptation. 

3. Daily prayers 
Psa 19:12-13
It’s hard for a person to know his own errors. When people tell us, seldom do we accept. This is natural. That’s why we continue to have these flaws. But we believers continue to search our hearts and review the errors/flaws in us, and to have the power of God to cleanse us from wrongdoings. Sometimes it’s just a wrong concept of values, influenced by friends who have these wrong concepts. These friends may be good and seen to be noble by others, but their concepts may not be biblical. So we need to pray ceaselessly to the Lord. Pray ceaselessly and present our requests to God with all thanksgiving. And He will keep our hearts in Jesus Christ. 

The life of faith is a journey. Sometimes through fire, sometimes through the wilderness. There’re a lot of hardships. Without wisdom and strength from God, we may totally lose our faith. But he who prays daily has wisdom from God. In times of trouble, the joy of the Lord will still strengthen Him. The faith God gives through the Holy Spirit will be like a shield to him enabling him to overcome. This is the victory God promises. But we must have the practice of daily prayer. Just like Daniel who was thrown into the lion’s den. He was favoured by the king but even the king couldn’t deliver him once the law was passed. Many things in the world happen this way. When we get into difficulties and troubles, when sickness comes, there’s a lot of pain, we know these things will come, how are we going to face it? How will we not deny Jesus Christ in such times? Only when Jesus is in us; when His spirit fills us. And the only way to always have Jesus in our lives having His presence fill our lives is to ceaselessly pray. Prayers can be sweet as honey. But if we don’t pray regularly, our prayers will be very short. 

A brother shared that he prayed twice a day. Once during lunch and once during dinner “thank you Lord” lol. He had believed in the Lord for so long and still hasn’t received the Holy Spirit/spoken in tongues. He felt it was unfair that others had received the Holy Spirit. Until he migrated to a small town in US where he didn’t have any friends. He needed Jesus Christ as his friends and prayed more. He received the Holy Spirit and started speaking in tongues. Then he said, “Now I’m really praying.” He had tasted the sweetness of prayer.

God wants us to taste this sweetness. Whether it’s worship, whether it’s reading the Bible, whether it’s prayer, with the presence of God, these are things we will always like to do.
