The Bible tells us to pray for many things, one of which is for the workers, because the work is plenty but the labourers are few. We should also seek for the Lord’s will on what to do, as we all have our roles. So aside from praying for more workers, we should also pray for wisdom to know our role.

Perhaps there is more we can do than what we are already doing. Or perhaps there’s a need for more adjustment so we align ourselves to the role God wants us to be. 
 
There is sometimes the case there is work people don’t want to do, not that they don’t see the need but because they feel they’re not suited for the job or someone else should do it. While some people think they can do certain things they can’t. Some people have certain blind spots; the need is there but undetected. 

The church is described as the spiritual Jerusalem. In his epistles to the Galatians, Paul tells us that there’s a Jerusalem on earth which is in bondage. But there’s also a Jerusalem which is above, which is where we have all been gathered to as Christians. He says that is our Mother. The book of Hebrews tells us we’re all gathered in the city of Jerusalem. This is because the heavenly Jerusalem is the church. 

When we look at the Old Testament, many descriptions of Jerusalem or Zion are applicable to us. 

Isa 60:18
The walls and gates of Jerusalem are called salvation and praise. This means that within her walls are a community of people that have been redeemed by God. And we are continually praising God because we are saved by Him. He’s not only our Creator but also our Saviour and Redeemer. 

The Bible also says the word of God will be preached from Jerusalem to the whole world. As Christians, we should strive for her continual welfare. 

Like Psa 122 tells us “Jerusalem is like a city compact together. It’s where all the tribes go.” “For the sake of my brethren, I seek your good.” This is where our brothers and sisters in Christ are. So seek the good of the church/Jerusalem. The welfare and peace of Jerusalem is something devout Jews pray for everyday. But we know the real Jerusalem is the church. So we as dwellers in Jerusalem, as Christians, should daily seek the welfare and peace of Jerusalem. 

Let us focus on praying for the welfare of the church so the church becomes the church Christ delights in. 

Neh 1
Nehemiah was working as a cupbearer of the king at that time. In the Persian palace, he heard news of Jerusalem. He asked Hanani one of his brethren concerning the Jews and Jerusalem.

Sometimes we do not know things because we do not bother to ask. 
“How come I don’t know this happened?” Because you didn’t ask.
“How do I know what to ask?” You will know what to ask if you know what’s happening. Some of us leave, talk, don’t pay attention when it comes to the announcements after prayer. 

Even if we don’t receive any news, we can always ask about the welfare of the church. It cannot be when we attend church every week, we don’t know what to ask about. Not only do we know what’s happening in Singapore, we know what’s happening elsewhere. 

Many of us know we’ve been helping the church in Myanmar for a good 20 years. Also in Batam and Batu Pahat. But the speaker seriously wonders how many of us ask about the welfare of the churches we help out in. We have a 4th church. The speaker wonders how many of us desire to take a look or whether we wonder how it is doing now. 

But when Nehemiah saw one of his brethren, he asked about the people in Jerusalem and their welfare. 

Whichever church we’re in, it’s important to ask about the welfare of other churches. Some of us hope TK and Adam can become mega churches, not hoping that we may have more churches around the island.

We shouldn’t blame others for not telling us. We should take the initiative to ask. Even better if we can visit the church for ourselves.

We should also be concerned for churches near us. After Singapore set up its coordination board, people still continued to help out in churches near us. This is positive work. Even better if we ask about the church.

The most basic thing we can do is to pray. 

Phil 2:19-24
Paul talks to Philippi about their welfare. v19-24 talks about those who are concerned and those who are not so concerned about the church. Paul was very anxious to hear about the state of the Philippians, so he sent Timothy to find out. Paul trusted Timothy as well, that Timothy would be as concerned about the Philippians as he was. 

v28-31 explains why he had to send Timothy. “I’ve no one likeminded who will so sincerely care for your faith.” “For all seek their own”
We think coming to church to worship God is enough. Minding our own business. This was something said about the people at that time. The speaker doesn’t think he was overly pessimistic. This is something we should be cautious about. Let us not be like the people around Paul at that time. 

Others may be indifferent but we should be concerned about Singapore at least. When it comes to Wednesday evening prayer, many of us come to seek the Holy Spirit. But for those of us who have already received the Holy Spirit, what kind of preparedness do we have when we come for Wednesday evening prayer? Since it’s a prayer service we should be prepared for prayer.

What do we pray for here as a church together? Apart from praying for the people kneeling in front, what are some of the things that have been flashed every service? Do we have it committed it to memory or do write it in our notes?

What have we been praying everyday about? If we have been leading a life of prayer and praying for the church, then we’ll be able to be prepared when here for Wednesday night services. Then it’ll be a real concerted prayer because we’re praying for the same thing. And we keep ourselves updated by asking. 

Neh 1
Hanani and the people who came told Nehemiah about the people in Jerusalem who were in great distress. The wall of Jerusalem were brown down and the gates were burnt with fire. 

“When I heard these words, I sat down and wept.”
Some people ask but they don’t hear. Sometimes it becomes a matter of politeness. “Oh how are you?”

Someone told the speaker that her supervisor at work knew that she was sick because she had been on MC/hospitalised. When she came back to work, the supervisor asked how she was. Before she could answer, the supervisor walked away. So was he really interested in her welfare? How would she have felt? It’s all fake right?

This happens in the world often. But let us not behave like that as Christians. 

Can you imagine a minister (preacher/deacon) or any of us asking a member how they are and walking away?

Some people pretend to hear. But they don’t really hear.

If we really heard and understood that the gates are burnt up and the walls are broken down, you will be like Nehemiah to sit down and weep. 

You will be in great distress. When you hear something like that, would you not ask for more details? What they need? What you can do?

That’s when you really hear. Nehemiah really heard and he was deeply affected. 

There was a time many people were concerned about the setting up of the 4th church in Serangoon. The church held briefings in all the churches and updated the congregation regularly (e.g. how many teachers are allocated there, to assure members that their children would be taken care of). There was a Friday night service held at girls’ brigade. It cost $320 a night. 20-30 people turned up. It was very sparse. So there was concern how many people would go if a church was set up in Serangoon. 

If Jerusalem is supposed to be a city compact together, it shouldn’t be a wall full of gaps with just a few stones left. 

Acts 8:14-15
This was a newly pioneered place; Philip had gone there to preach. But those who believed had not received the Holy Spirit. Concerned, Peter and John went down. Likewise, Paul and Timothy were concerned for the church. Timothy was sent to find out and report back to Paul. 

If we hear and don’t act, know that our adversaries will hear and act. 

Neh 4:1, 7-8
When Sanballat heard they walls of Jerusalem were being restored, he was furious and very indignant. A group of them transpired to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion.

Both Nehemiah and the group heard the same thing, but different emotions were evoked; negative ones for the latter.

They acted. How about Nehemiah? Of course he acted, because he saw the need. 

In Myanmar, we preach. But an ex-preacher who committed adultery also acted. He set up his own church and taught his own teachings. Another preacher went to interpret for him. He acted but for the wrong camp. He too was excommunicated. 

Neh 1:11
Nehemiah prayed. Why did he pray? Because he saw the need to rebuild Jerusalem. He asked, he heard, he saw the need to rebuild Jerusalem. 

So he asked that the Lord grant him favour before the presence of the king that he served.

He saw the problem. Not only that, he saw his personal responsibility. And therefore he fasted and prayed. He saw it as his responsibility to confess of his own sins and for his nation. 

He identified himself with the people of Judah. “WE have acted against you and have not kept the commandments.”

He didn’t just see the problem. He also saw the solution. The solution was to get the people to return to God, to obey the commandments, to go back to Jerusalem. He saw his role. What he could do, and what he should do. 

We SHOULD do what we CAN do right? 
And don’t expect people to do what we CAN do. 

When we see a difficulty ahead, we pray God clears the difficulty for us. Therefore Nehemiah prayed to be granted mercy in the sight of the king. And God allowed the king to know Nehemiah was troubled, and we know the rest of the story. 

Start off with a genuine concern. Then our prayer will be sincere and listened to by God. Ask God to help us see the needs and gaps in the church, and what we as individuals can do.
