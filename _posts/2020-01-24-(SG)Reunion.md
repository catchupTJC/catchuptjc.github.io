One important tradition Chinese keep is the reunion dinner. The speaker recalls that when he was a child, he enjoyed and looked forward to reunion dinners because the dishes would miraculously double, he could wear his new pyjamas, receive angpaos from the adults, and play with sparkles at night. On the first day of new year, many of his cousins would gather at his grandparents’ house. They would catch butterflies, pretend to be superheroes and dress up like one. All in all, reunion is a time the whole family gathers together; where we recount the blessings we have as a family, seated at the same table. This is even more so when we think about the CoronaVirus out there. There’re people who can’t go back to China because of this. The speaker’s colleague decided not to go back because her hometown is just beside Wuhan. This would be her first time missing reunion dinner. For us who have been able to gather for reunion dinner, it is truly God’s blessing. We share a meal together, talk about the olden times, and create memories of the future. 

What does the Bible talk about regarding reunion? 3 stories from the Bible will be shared. 

1. Reunion of the prodigal son and his father  
Luke 15:11-24  
A man had two sons. The younger one told his father he wanted his portion of the inheritance so he could go enjoy himself. He squandered it on prodigal living, consequently becoming poor. There was a famine in the land; he joined himself to be a citizen of the country and was sent to deed the swines in the field. The younger son used to be under the protection of the father. But because of bad decisions he made, he ended up in such a situation - feeding swine in a foreign country. He now had 3 options to take. 

First, he could blame it on the environment; there was a severe famine (v14). He could blame the government (v15). He became a citizen of the country and ended up feeding swine. “What kind of government is that?”

But we know blaming doesn’t solve any problems. It would be the greatest mistake of election. Recall how Adam in the garden of Eden blamed Eve, who blamed the serpent. But blaming the environment and others won’t solve the problem. 

Second, he could continue playing the game; to deceive himself and continue living with the swine; to deny his status of a son who could be in his father’s house. He could try to marry someone there. 

There was a man asked to put on a Cookie Monster costume and make a speech for a fund raising event. He willingly agreed to it, thinking it was for a charity event. But the problem was that the costume was very thick. Moreover, the weather was very hot; it was in the thick of summer. In the thick costume in the hot of summer, the man’s glasses started fogging up. Because of that, he couldn’t see where the podium was. He started to worry, knowing he had to get up on the podium for the speech. He whispered to people around him, “Please help me. I can’t see where the podium is.” But nobody could hear him because the costume was too thick. So he tried to gesture for help. But the more he gestured, the more the people clapped thinking he was entertaining them. This was truly a situation where his fears were hidden behind a costume. His desperate cries for help were thought to be signs of joy. A troubled man in a happy Cookie Monster costume. 

In some way, it describes how people live in the world today. We may be very troubled inside; we may have a lot of problems, but we still put on this Cookie Monster costume. Inside is a man trying to call for help, but we keep the costume on. 

The prodigal son could continue on and be in the Cookie Monster costume. 

Thirdly, he could return to his father. This was the option he chose. Turning back to God/his father resulted in a beautiful reunion. v17 says this prodigal son came for himself; he made this realisation. “How many of my father’s servants have bread enough to spare while I’m starving.” “Yes I’ve done a big mistake towards my father, squandered away the inheritance he gave me. I’m totally accountable for the state I’m in. But I’m also making the choice not to continue in this state. I want to return to my father.” That was the turning point for this man. 

He intended to tell his father, “I’m not worthy to be your son, let me be your servant.” When his father saw him from afar, he ran, fell on his neck and wept.

As Jesus was speaking of this parable, perhaps amongst the audience was a tax collector who thought, “I have no face to return to God after all I’ve oppressed others.” Perhaps a woman who sinned, “It’s impossible for I have sinned against my husband.” When Jesus noticed all these thoughts, could He have opened His arms even wider?

“Yes you’ve messed up your life. But you can return.” And when He says that, He opens His arms even wider. 

And Jesus opened His arms so wide, they were nailed on the cross. 

We may have messed up today. But as long as we live, don’t blame others or the government. Don’t play the game of inaction, pretending that nothing has happened. Obviously things are already happening but we’re unwilling to do shutting. Let’s be like the prodigal son to choose the third option to return. Because he decided to come back to God, the beautiful picture of reunion came to pass. This beautiful picture of reunion can happen to us too. 

Today we have reunion with our family members. But are we able to reunite with them at the table with the Lord? That can only happen if we turn back. 

2. Reunion of Joseph and his brothers  
Gen 45:1-8  
The reunion of Joseph and his brothers teaches us the lesson of forgiveness. His brothers had done much evil to Joseph - sold him to Egypt, betrayed his trust. In Egypt, a series of misfortunes befell him. He was bought as a slave in Potiphar’s house. Potiphar’s wife accused him of trying to take advantage of her, causing him to be thrown into prison. In prison, he helped a cup bearer and asked him to remember him. But he forgot. 

Joseph truly went through many things. Perhaps he could’ve thought: “This all happened because of my brothers.” The Bible doesn’t record this of course, but it’s true this all started because his brothers sold him to Egypt. Fast forward several years and now Joseph is a somebody “a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt”. 

When Joseph was a nobody, of course he couldn’t do anything to his brothers.  
Because he saw the higher purpose of why he went through all these things. And he was able to see this because he brought God into the picture. Because of that, he was able to open his heart and forgive his brothers. This was the defining moment in this story. Joseph, a person of high status, coming down to his brothers, admitting who he was and weeping. It shows his complete acceptance. 

In our lives, there may be people who have offended us at different stages. We may meet with many unhappy things that we may think is a result of someone doing something to us. 

A story in Auschwitz on Francis Zach(?). In A, 4 million Jews died. Half a ton of human hair was found. The showers that sprayed poison are still there. In the midst of these dark memories, there was a happier memory by Coby(?). In July 1941 in the concentration camp, a prisoner escaped. It’s customary for the Nazis to kill 10 prisoners for every 1 who escaped. This was randomly selected from the row book. They would be taken from their cells, given no food and drink until they die. The 10th name called was Francis Zach. When called he cried out, “My wife! My children!” It was complete silence and then they heard movements of someone tried to go to the front. It was Coby.  
“I want to talk to the commander.” “Permission granted.”  
“I want to die in the place of this prisoner. I’ve no wife or children. I’m old and good for nothing.”  
“What are you?”  
“I’m a priest.”

There was great silence. Then the words, “Request granted.” The prisoners weren’t allowed to speak. 

Francis Zach writes: “I could only thank him with my eyes. A total stranger voluntarily offered up his life for me. Is this a dream?”

A man called Barrabas was supposed to be crucified the next morning but was miraculously set free because Jesus took his place. 

Coby outlives the other 9. The officers had to inject poison into his heart. Francis Zach survives the Holocaust, and went back to his home. Every year, he would return to Auschwitz to thank the man who died in his place. 

We may find it difficult to forgive people in our hearts. But may this story remain in our hearts. 

Jesus took our place to die. What’s preventing us from forgiving others?

Incidentally, Barrabas’ name means ‘son of father’. The ‘son of God’ died in place of the ‘son of father’. We are sons of a father and the son of God died in our place. He forgave us. What’s preventing us from forgiving others?

The reunion of Joseph and his brothers is one of forgiveness. Let our reunions every year be like this too. 

Col 3:12-13  
We’re God’s beloved. Let Holy Spirit put on tender mercies. Let us put aside our pride; let’s be humble. Let’s not talk about up-keeping our status in the family. Let’s be humble, kind and bear with one another. Forgive each other. If anyone has a complaint against each other, forgive as the Lord forgave you. 

3. Reunion of Jesus and His saints when He returns  
Parting with our loved ones is never an easy experience. The speaker personally remembers the very last reunion dinner he had with his father. After that, there was always an empty seat at the table. But Christians have the hope there’ll be a final reunion in heaven. This is the lively hope we all have. The Bible has a beautiful way of describing death; it is like falling asleep. We know a person who falls asleep will wake up. We may have lost someone dear in the course of this year. It may take time to nurse this hurt. Each time during family reunions, there may be someone missing. It evokes memories of the person and emotions of sadness from missing the person.

So we need to be reminded of the final reunion we have with God. 

1 Thess 4:13-18  
These verses are usually read during condolence services. There will come a day we have the hope to meet the Lord in the air. 

We may already have had reunion dinner with the family we have right now. Will this be the last like this? Will anyone be missing next year? We never know; anything can happen. Just like the Wuhan virus. 

But what we believe is that even if we aren’t at the table next year, we’ve merely fallen asleep. One day we’ll wake up and with great joy be reunited with our loved ones in heaven. 

Reunions are joyous occasions. We need to treasure each reunion we have. Ponder the teaching of coming home. Reunion teaches us the need to forgive one another. And reunion reminds us there’s a final reunion with God in heaven. Each reunion brings us closer to the final reunion with God.

May God bless each and every of our reunions.
