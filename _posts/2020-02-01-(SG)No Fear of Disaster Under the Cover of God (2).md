Today, we have experienced many pestilences, which are serious diseases. 

Pestilence have two sources. One is man made as a result of the polluted environment. The second is from God who gives the pestilence to Man as a form of punishment. In the past, millions have been affected and died due to pestilence. 

Wuhan virus, SARS, Black Death, Smallpox, Cholera are some examples. These pestilences were caused by microorganisms and were a result of an unclean environment. In the midst of pandemics, without God, man will be frantic and fearful. It appears man is very advanced in medical science today; we have invented much medication to fight these viruses. But viruses can mutate and continue to harm mankind. It goes to show how fragile man’s life is. 

Amongst all the created beings of God, man is considered relatively physically weaker. Because of our brains, we have invented many weapons to protect ourselves. But in physical strength, we are weaker than many animals. Some animals have claws for protection, man don’t. Our immune systems aren’t as strong either. For example, viruses are able to live in the small mosquitoes’ body but once passed to man, we are adversely affected. If not for God’s protection, man is oftentimes not stronger than the rest of God’s created beings. 

Under the cover of God, we need not fear these pestilences. But sometimes even if we are under His cover, we may meet with pestilences. In the Bible, God sent a pestilence to those who were disobedient to Him. The word ‘pestilence’ occurs over 70 times in the Bible. 

2 Sam 24:13-15  
When David made a census of the Israelites, it displeased God. He was given 3 punishment options; David chose a plague from God that killed 70,000 men. This is more than the number of people who have died due to the Wuhan virus. 

Why did God allow them to meet with this plague despite being under His cover? It is a warning from God to man about their sins. 

Peter writes in the New Testament that “judgement begins from the household of God”. Why? People in the world who don’t believe in God have already fallen to judgement. But those under the cover and grace of God must receive judgement from God too. This is like how God judged both the Egyptians and Israelites; this displays His fairness. God sends pestilences and plagues to turn man back to repentance. 

In David’s case, 70,000 men died. Some may ask, “Why does God do this? Where is His love?”

Num 25:8-9  
The Israelites committed harlotry with the women of Moab. God sent a plague where 24,000 died. Why would God who is love send such a plague to men? Besides focusing on God’s love, we need to consider His righteousness and justice. Besides looking at the plague that killed people, there’s also a need to look at the plague of sin that harmed the souls of the people. While it seems cruel that God took the lives of people, it’s actually a display of His love to saved the people spiritually. 

God pays more attention to the spiritual pestilence that affects our faith. If He doesn’t act, the spiritual pestilence will take even more spiritual lives. 

Paul has this same focus.  
1 Cor 5:6-7  
When Paul rebuked the church in Corinth, he used the analogy of a little leaven leavening then whole lump to rebuke them for allowing sin to remain in the church. 

“It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles — that a man has his father’s wife! And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you.”

Leaven represents sin. If it spreads, the holiness of the church will be affected. It’s like an infectious diseases that’ll make the church unholy. That’s why when the Holy Communion is conducted, the congregation is warned not to partake of it if one has committed sin unto death. 

Do not allow sin to harm your spiritual life. Do not think you’re safe just because you’re under the cover of God. We shouldn’t only focus on God’s love and neglect that He’s righteous and just too. As Christian, we have to pursue a holy consecrated life; compliant to the commandments of God. 

People in the world have the mindset that as long as they don’t have problems and God takes care of them, that’s enough. So they worship God but still do what they like. “If I can’t do what I like then I’ll just change God.”  
That’s why the Israelites committed idolatry. The gods they worshipped enabled them to satisfy their lusts - there were temple prostitutes, they could erect idols (easier to worship since there’s something to see). This would be ideal for someone who still wants to indulge in their fleshly desires. 

The speaker met someone who said:  
“God I want Your cover of protection but I don’t want to have to keep everything You command. Just protect me and I bring benefit to You too by offering money.”

At first, the speaker was shocked by this but later realised this was not new; the Israelites had such a mindset as well.

If we want to receiver the protection under the cover of God, we must pursue holiness. We shouldn’t worship Him according to how we want to. 

Psa 91:14  
“Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name.”  
God abides with the man who loves God and will protect him from all calamities. 

A few verses up v11-12 is what Satan quoted to tempt Jesus in Matt 4:6. Satan told Him that if He was the Son of God, He should throw Himself down.  
“For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.”

Why did Satan use this to tempt Jesus? Because Man innately like glory and to be loved. There’s nothing wrong with being loved but it may cause us to be proud. 

Jesus didn’t need to prove that He was the Son of God by means of throwing Himself down.

Treating God as someone who can always fulfil our wishes may cause us to be bitter when He doesn’t help us when we want Him to. We may start making demands to show us a sign and then threaten to not worship Him anymore if He doesn’t. 

Exo 16:2-3  
The Israelites tested God.

Something like this happened. There was a talented worker in church, but the IA realised there was something amiss about him. When he spoke sermons, he said often that he was very strong. Once, he closed his eyes and walked across a busy road unscathed. He claimed he wasn’t afraid of Satan and wanted to duel face to face with Satan. At night, members observed he seemed to be talking to someone. Members were sent to speak to him but he refused to heed them. On one occasion, he jumped off from the 4th floor and died. Why did he do that? The last of his writings showed that he was tempting God. He wanted God to prove that He was with him. Those who knew him said it was such a waste for he was very talented and knowledgeable. The more talented we are, the more we have to be careful not to be proud. That’s why God allowed a thorn to be in Paul’s flesh, lest he be too exalted. 

When we love God with all our hearts, He will protect us.  
John 14:15  
“If you love Me, keep My commandments.”

A man who loves God with all his heart will never tempt God regardless of what situation He’s in. Even in suffering, he will choose to keep the commandments, because his hope is eternal life. 

How Jesus handled Satan’s temptation is an example to us. 

Not fearing disaster under the cover of God doesn’t just pertain to physical harm, but spiritual harm as well. 

Let us also be careful not to be pestilences ourselves.  
2 Tim 2:17  
“And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort.”

We need to be able to discern truth from false teachings. Let’s not be spiritual cancer to others, but lead people to the grace of God instead.

If we listen to the word of God and act according to it, we’ll be like the man who built his house on the rock, unafraid of storms. 

We need to be pestilences in a good sense.  
Acts 24:5  
When Paul was undergoing trial, his accusers said Paul and his men are like a plague. We know they were a ‘good plague’ because they spread the gospel to all Asia. 

Today, Christians should be propagators of the truth. We should spread the gospel quickly like a plague. This gospel saves lives instead of taking lives. We have to be proactive in preaching. 

Being under the cover of God doesn’t mean: “Oh we’re safe under this cover! We shouldn’t go out and preach where we may get harmed!”

While we are under the cover of God, we shouldn’t just focus on having physical peace and comfort. 

The greatest plague of men is death, but Jesus has overcome death. Let’s not be afraid of death nor a slave of sin. 

There’re two areas we can be victorious in when relying on Jesus.  
Heb 2:14-15  
Firstly, Jesus has overcome the power of death. Under His cover, we can overcome death. Because of that, we as Christians shouldn’t fear dying. Secondly, Jesus gives us the power to overcome sin. Let not sin reign in our lives anymore. 

Under the cover of God, we don’t meet with disasters. But if we choose not to obey His words and degenerate like how the Israelites did, then we ought to be fearful.
