It is during chaotic times where we should count our blessings. Since the outside is so chaotic, we start to look inside; we start to look at the God that has taken care of us thus far. The reason why people stocked up on Maggie Mee is because of fear.

Mark 5:1-20
Take 2min to read this passage from the perspective of the demon possessed man. 

Some questions to consider:
1. Does this demon possessed person have a father and mother? Sure have right? Where were they then? v3 “He was living alone in the tombs.” No family meh?

2. v4 “because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him.”
Who chained him? Family? Villagers? How did he feel?

3. v5 “And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.”
Who was crying out? The demon? Or was it the man in despair? Was he cutting himself to commit suicide?

4. Jesus came all the way from the other side to the Gadarenes just to heal him. Evidence? Jesus only healed this guy and then was chased away by the villagers because the pigs died. 

The guy must’ve thought: When no one understood what I was going through, this man Jesus did. And now all they want to do is drive Him away??

v18 “And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him.”
Why? Because Jesus was the only one he could trust when no one else was there for him. 

v19-20 “However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marvelled.”

Like the demon possessed person, we each have our own stories; we each have blessings God has given us. But we’re so busy with our lives, we forget the blessings. 9 out of the 10 leper’s forgot - 90%. Are you the 10% that remembers?

Think about one thing you can give thanks to God for today (9 Feb 12am-11.34am). Went one round of sharing. 
“Thank God I’m able to breathe.”
“Thank God my family in China are still well.”
“Thank God I didn’t scratch my father’s car while going up the multi-storey carpark.” (it’s v narrow!!)
“Thank God brethren went out of the way to give me a lift.”
“Thank God the rain didn’t get heavier when I got caught in it while on a run this morning.”
“Thank God one aircon still works.” (context: there’re two aircons. One of them started leaking badly at the start of the service)
“Thank God for a nice talk with my mum this morning.”

This is to make us conscious that God has done many things in our life, many of which we take for granted. If we look at our entire lives in context, what do we feel is that one thing God did for us that moved us at a personal level, just like this demon possessed person?

There is definitely one. But we need time to think. Don’t keep living life brainlessly. If you were to get into a car accident today; if you were to go for a medical checkup (would you be prepared for the results?); if you suddenly get a fever and start coughing...HAHAHA

What would I say to Jesus Christ? “Give me one more day, I’ll live my life properly!” Just like in choir just make sure your last note is zunzun then everyone will think it’s hou zeng

Try to settle your account with God everyday. Today, how Christian/non-Christian have I been?

Testimony about a couple. Shi Sang’s peer in Jurong JC, well known because he was in the soccer team. Sad story to read as a parent. He got married. His wife gave birth. At 12 weeks, the baby was diagnosed that it may not live throughout - acrania (google it, pics are heart breaking). The baby’s skull wasn’t able to form properly. Life out of womb is impossible. As Christians, they took the faith to carry pregnancy until full term. Everyone was waiting for a miracle but after giving birth, the baby only lived for 18h. Through Christ’s strength, how he tides over this period of time can be read in this link. https://thir.st/blog/zachary-lee-eulogy-for-his-son-emme/

Shi Sang read it from the perspective of a mother. When she first held her baby, she thought about how she was a mother now and about her baby’s life ahead. But this couple was only able to be parents for 18h. They’ll never be able to see him graduate, get married, etc. May have thoughts like: “Already decided to carry to full term. Why no miracle?” When the baby came out and you see the skull is really deformed, you’ll still hope some miracle will happen. 

But the miracle you hoped for didn’t happen. What would you be thinking? Would you think: “God why’re you so cruel? Why only give me 18h?”

But this couple didn’t think: “Why only 18h?” They were thinking: “Thank God for at least 18h.”
They gave praise to God and acknowledged God is God. 

When something happens in our lives - maybe a car accident, our loved ones die, we fall sick. There’re two ways we can think.

1) “Why God do you let this happen? Why only 18h?”

2) “Thank You for giving me all this time to enjoy your grace until now. Thank You for letting me have my loved ones in my life until now.”

Thank God for what we have and not what we hope to have. 

Let us think back in our lives for anything we can give thanks to God for like this couple. Even if it’s a bad thing/disaster, we can take it from the positive side and give thanks to God through it all. 

Take some time off and think about that one grace from God you feel on a personal level. It may not necessary have been something very happy.

Think of one thing God has done for you on a personal level. It may have been a very trying time. Like the demon possessed man. But what Jesus did for him motivated him to preach in Decapolis!

Think of that story. That story will remind you this is your God that will carry you through even when the world is going crazy outside. When things start going bad, that one story will carry you through. Even if things don’t seem to get better now, you’ll remember: He got you through then, He’ll get you through this time too.

Take the time to think of that one story. Write it down. Keep it in your Bible for bad days. 

1 Thess 5:18
“Give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”
