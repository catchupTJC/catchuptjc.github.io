Why does the Bible refer to Elijah as the chariots and horsemen of Israel?

2 Kings 2:12
It was Elisha who called Elijah the chariots and horsemen of Israel. It wasn’t Elijah who called himself that. Why would Elisha use this term?

The context was that Elijah was about to be taken by God. Elisha his disciple followed him to his last moments. In the last period of Elijah’s life, this happened. As they were walking and talking together, suddenly a chariot separated them and Elijah went up in a whirlwind. This was the context that caused Elisha to call Elijah this term; to have this epiphany. 

God could’ve taken Elijah with just a simple whirlwind, but God used a chariot of fire. This was because God wanted Elisha to understand the person before him (Elijah) was the chariot and horsemen of Israel. 

In those days, wars were fought with chariots and horses. They represented the troops of the nation. This vision allowed Elijah and Elisha to know Elijah is the chariot/troop of the Lord. When we look at the entire life of Elijah, we see he manifests the chariot and horsemen of the Lord because he represented and fought battles for the Lord. 

In 1 Kings we see how Elijah triumphed over the 850 false prophets, and led the people back to the worship of the one true God. 

Truly, Elijah being referred to as the chariot and horsemen of Israel is apt. This term doesn’t just refer to Elijah. It was used on Elisha as well.

2 Kings 13:14
Jehoash, the king of Israel, also referred to Elisha as the chariot and horsemen of Israel. This was because Elisha took over Elijah and was in charge of religious reformation in Israel.

If we have the same zeal as Elijah, we can also be known as the chariot and horsemen of Israel. In this sermon, we still study the Bible character Elijah. What did he do to deserve this title?

1 Kings 17:1
v1 introduces Elijah. He lived in Gilead; he was a Tishbite. There’re no records of any other prophets that originated from Gilead or was a Tishbite. Elijah’s birthplace wasn’t renowned. There’s no record of him being a prophet before 1 Kings 17:1. Because it’s an unknown place, it’s unknown if there was a prophet school there (there used to be prophet schools then). We don’t have much information on Elijah. Perhaps he was just a normal person, or perhaps already a prophet before this. Perhaps God spoke to him. We do not know if the statement he made towards Ahab in 1 Kings 17:1 is directly from God. 

How was King Ahab like? We don’t know if he was good in politics or economics. But according to the Bible, what we know is there was not a character like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the Lord (1 Kings 21:25). Perhaps due to Jezebel his wife. But it’s also his fault for listening to her. 450 false prophets managed the worship of Baal. Any person who still truly worshipped God would feel sad for the nation. There were still true prophets in the land e.g. Obadiah hid 100 prophets (1 Kings 18:4). Not only Elijah remained faithful to God. Why didn’t the 101 prophets accuse Ahab? Why were they just preserving their faith in the dark? Compared to the rest of the people, they were already very good because they had preserved their faith. But why didn’t they do more? Compare them to Elijah who stepped up to Ahab not just to warn him, but to threaten him “If I don’t pray, there’ll be no rain.” Some people may think him an extremist. Would we be like Elijah or a secret believer like Obadiah?

So why was Elijah called the chariot and horsemen of Israel? He was willing to step forward for God. It seems like an easy task - just stepping out and saying a few words. But actually this put his life at risk. Prophets who said nothing and hid in the dark were in danger. What more a prophet who stood up to the king. 

Elijah knew this would happen when he stepped up. But he was willing to do it and assume responsibility of doing this. 

Many people are willing to serve God. When they’re first asked, they’re willing to do it. But when there’re a lot of added responsibilities, many want to give up and can’t hold on to the end. 

After Elijah stood up to Ahab, he could only wait for God to give the command. 3.5 years. Not exactly long but not exactly short as well. Every 3 years, we go through a change in our lives. 

Elijah waited with patience and trust. This is something we should emulate. 

Why was Elijah so persistent and why was he willing to step forward to do this?

1 Kings 17:1
“As the Lord God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these guests, except at my word.”
Why did Elijah make such a statement of judgement there and then? Did he think no rain would catch the people’s attention? Actually such a judgement was already long recorded in the 5 Books of Moses. 

Deut 11:16-17
God already warned that if the people turned away from Him, the heavens would be shut; there would be no rain. 

So when Elijah pronounced judgement, he reference what Moses said. Whether God directly told Elijah to say this or whether Elijah was inspired to remember Moses’ words is unclear. Assuming God didn’t directly tell Elijah to speak to Ahab, we see Elijah was a person who read the records in the Old Testament. He believed such things would happen. Through the moving of God, he pronounced judgement on Ahab and the land. 

Elijah had a vision for his nation and how it ought to be. It’s from this ideal he had for this nation with reference to God’s word was he able to see the judgement that would be meted out to them. That’s why Elijah stepped forth to do this work. Because he knew doing so is in line with God’s word. 

Today we are all called by the Lord. Just like Elijah, we ought to serve the Lord; have courage like Elijah to step forth and assume responsibly. You must have a dream for the Kingdom of God. 

Many of us don’t have a vision of what we want to do for God. Thank God most of us are responsible Christians - what the church tells us to do, we do it. But does the work we do inspire others to do more?

Elijah could’ve told Ahab, “The Scriptures say this and this, so you should repent.” Or he could’ve just sent a letter. Why did he pronounce judgement? “There’ll be no rain in this land unless at my word.” The next thing Ahab would naturally do would be to force him to pray for rain. 

Elijah could’ve made ‘safe statements’ that would implicate himself less. He was dutiful/responsible AND went above and beyond his calling. 

When the theological seminar is run, 3 meals are provided everyday. The purpose is to feed the participants and the duty would be fulfilled by simply cooking fried rice everyday. But we know by the 3rd/4th day, people would be a bit sick of it. 

As Christians, we shouldn’t just focus on being dutiful but going an extra mile. Jesus Christ made the ultimate sacrifice of offering Himself on the cross. 

Often we don’t go the extra mile. We don’t even reflect on our service. As an RE teacher, is our duty just to teach in that 1h? No one can say we are irresponsible and don’t do our duty. But how about outside of class? We’re nurturing a LIFE. Our duty is not just restricted to that 1h contact in class but also their lives. Are we limiting ourselves and our service to God?

Elijah wasn’t like that. 

After that, he had to challenges the false prophets. 1 vs 850 false prophets, Ahab, and the people who worshipped idols. It was 1 person against such a great multitude. But he was willing to do so because he knew this was something he had to do. 

While Elijah was exemplary, there were still some things God wanted to teach him.

1 Kings 19:1-2
v2 Jezebel heard that the prophets of Baal were executed and sought to kill Elijah. So Elijah ran for his life. He was afraid. 

v10 After 40 days (of running and resting), Elijah had the opportunity to complain, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”

In other words Elijah was saying, “I’ve tried so hard to serve God. But after trying so hard they want to kill me. And I’m the only one left.”

We see how he repeats himself again in v14 “I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”

He thought: I’m the only one serving God. I did so much good but no one appreciated it. 

So what caused this drastic change in Elijah? How did the same man who persevered for 3.5 years and stood up against 850 false prophets turn to suicidal thoughts? He had the wrong mindset. 

Firstly, he was result orientated. “I did so much and nothing changed.” If some people had repented and someone came after his life, perhaps he wouldn’t have felt so bad. 

This is a wrong attitude we have when we serve God. When we don’t see results we may question ourselves, “Since nobody comes why did I still do this. Just stop it.”

How many members come for every service in a year over the years? Few. The preacher could say to call off the Sabbath service, especially with COVID-19. 

How many people really listen and reflect after a sermon? After the sermon that says certain things, the members after service say the opposite. This seems discouraging, but it’s a process we must face as the people of God are led. 

God is in charge of the process. In the Bible, God spoke to the people but not all listened. 

Elijah didn’t understand this was part of his service to God. He was just the front part of this entire service. As God replied him in v15-16, God gave him 3 people to seek. God told him these 3 people would succeed his work so don’t worry about results. “Just do your job dutifully. If there’re no results it’s ok, just do your job responsibly.”

The second problem was that he felt he was the alone. So God told him there were still 7000 people who haven’t bowed their knee to Baal. Maybe you only think there’re 101 from Obadiah. Don’t think too highly of yourself you’re not the only one serving God! 

Sometimes when we serve God, we think we’re the only one doing work. We feel superior that we’re doing it, so others must listen to us. But how can it be the case that we’re the only one serving?

We are servants of God. What more, we are WORTHLESS servants of God that aren’t worth being used but God graciously allows us to serve Him. 

When we’re serving we may feel very tired and feel like no one else is helping. But we don’t need to feel too sad. God knows what we’re doing and He’ll raise up people. 

God had to correct this wrong attitude of Elijah’s. After correction, Elijah no longer has this wrong mentality. After the change, he became the chariot and horsemen of Israel. 

May God guide us to serve faithfully like Elijah.
