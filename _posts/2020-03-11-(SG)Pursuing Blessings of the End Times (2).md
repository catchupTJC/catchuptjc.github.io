Revelation tells us about the End Times and also how God will bring about salvation. One day, God will bring the evil in the world to an end, and bring eternal life into fulfilment. 

Recall the first blessing discussed in the previous sermon:
Rev 1:3
“Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.”
Not only do we need to listen to the word of God, we also need to act on it, and then we will be blessed. 

The word of God is like a mirror. It helps us to see our shortcomings and sins. We should humbly repent and willingly change ourselves and we realise we have sinned against Him, so we may be perfected in the eyes of God. 

We now move on to the second blessing.
Rev 14:13
“Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.”
Most people don’t like to discuss death, especially non-believers. This is because people see death as the end of everything; as something bad. But God and people see things differently. People think the longer they live, the better it is. People see death as the end of everything, but God sees death as the point that determines whether a person goes to heaven or hell. We cannot say a person that we currently see lives faithfully to the Lord will definitely be saved, because we never know if he will fall between now and death. Our faith may change. Therefore we need to continue to strive, endure, and keep the faith to the end of our lives. 

We may be in the Lord now. But if we commit mortal sins, we are no longer saved. Like Judas Iscariot who followed Jesus and witnessed many miracles. Due to greed, he fell. 

If we are still with a Christ at the point our flesh dies, it is a blessing. We have died in the Lord and enter eternal life. Just like when we read storybooks or watch a movie, the end makes or breaks the book/movie. We want to make sure our story/lives have a happy ending too. 

Eccl 7:1-2
“A good name is better than precious ointment, And the day of death than the day of one’s birth; 
Better to go to the house of mourning Than to go to the house of feasting, For that is the end of all men; And the living will take it to heart.”

Attending condolence services of brothers and sisters who have passed is a reminder for us to reflect on our faith - what is its state now?

The early Christians had to endure many sufferings to keep their faith. Today, especially in Singapore, we hardly meet with persecutions. At most, we get persecuted by family members who are against our going to church. Most of the time it’s us struggling against our fleshly desires, or struggle to come to church because of how busy work is. We struggle not because we’re persecuted, but because we feel we don’t have enough time. When we meet with temptations, we feel we struggle not to yield. Again this is because of our fleshly desires and not because we are persecuted.

We may one day face persecutions like the early Christians. We do not know what God’s will is for us. Peter, a disciple of Jesus, was going to be executed but was saved from prison. Stephen on the other hand, also a disciple of Jesus, was stoned to death. This doesn’t mean Jesus loved him any less (recall how he saw the heavens open and Jesus at the right hand of God). Not everyone has the blessing to be martyred in the Lord. 

Many of us hope we don’t face persecutions. We hope to experience a painless death. But if it’s God’s will, we may face persecutions. It is therefore important to pray for God’s mercy to preserve our souls and die in the faith. 

The saddest/worst case is when we’ve held on to the faith almost all our lives and then fall right at the end. Some members attended RE from young and served fervently as a youth, but today, they’re not with us anymore. Not because they have returned to the Lord but because they have departed from the faith, rejecting the truth they held on so strongly in the past. Their faith has changed, their heart has grown cold, they’re no longer zealous. 

We hold the Lord’s hand tightly when we have nothing. But when our hands our full, we let go of God’s hand. 

A sister in Jakarta came to Singapore because her brother was hospitalised for treatment. He wasn’t a member. The speaker spoke with her and found out she was his oldest brother’s classmate. She used to be a fervent youth in the past and he thought she was still fervent. He asked, “I remember how fervent you were last time. Are you in the EXCO now?”
“Yes last time. But now, no. My husband doesn’t like me to be so involved.”
“Didn’t you marry a church brother?”
“Yes but he doesn’t come anymore.”
She only went for Saturday morning services now, and her 3 children don’t go to church anymore. Her husband was unhappy that he had to wait for her to be done in church before they could go home. 

The closer we are to the end times, the more people will depart; keeping the word becomes harder. Many who were baptised last time are no longer with us anymore because they have fallen away, not keeping the word of God in their hearts. 

It’s a blessing if we’re still in church today, and that we remain for the rest of our lives. Sometimes we worry people who go through too much suffering leave God because they’re in too much pain. But actually the pain draws them closer to God. Sadly, it is when they recover that they leave God. 

Rev 14:13
Why are those who die in the Lord blessed? Because they no longer need to labour. In Singapore, the retirement age was 62. In 2030, it’ll be raised to 65, and the reemployment age to 70. That’s good news.  But that also means we have to continue labouring. The cost of living in Singapore keeps increasing, so we must continue labouring for longer. Oftentimes we’re very worried about our retirement age because we’re afraid we don’t have enough retirement money. Sometimes we still need to support our children when they have grown old. Some still have to take care of their grandchildren. 

There is much labour in this world, but Rev 14:13 records “that they may rest from their labours and their works follow them”. This is truly one of the greatest blessings we should pursue - to die in the Lord. 

A boy aged 13 named Raphael contracted brain cancer. Even though he was young, he glorified Jesus. He became a living testimony to many, including the speaker. When he first arrived in Singapore, he was in critical condition. Because his parents couldn’t speak English, the speaker accompanied them to the hospital so he could help to interpret for them. From a layman perspective, the speaker gauged the boy was in very bad condition. The doctor examined him and said to give up; that there was no hope. Even if the surgery was successful, he might become handicapped. The speaker said it was difficult translating this for them. The parents cried bitterly. “Why Raphael? He was such a good boy. He’s always read the Bible.” Members in Indonesia and Singapore prayed for him. Thank God the surgery was successful and God extended his life for another 2 years. But his cancer relapsed and he was called to the Lord. However, he has become a beautiful testimony for many of us. We witness how he strove and endured to keep his faith until the end. He rested in the Lord from his labours, and his works follow him. Blessed is he who dies in the Lord. 

We strive in our work and earn income. That’s the value we get. But we can’t bring it to heaven unless we exchange it. Like when we go overseas, we need to exchange the currency. In this world, we need to exchange our labour for money, but this money will only last in this world. How can we get something that’ll last till heaven? If we labour for the Lord. 

Cooking for your family and cooking for church is different. Cleaning your house and the church is different. Cooking/cleaning the church up is more tiring because it’s bigger, but we feel happier because it’s for the Lord. Fetching your children from school and fetching children to church is also different.

Everything we do for the Lord will be deposited in heaven. 

Matt 6:19-21
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”
As Christians, we need to pay special attention to His word. These verses aren’t telling us which financial plan is better. The Lord reminds us to lay up treasure in heaven. We labour in this world, but not to build up our wealth here because we can’t bring any to heaven. When we work for the Lord, not for our own glory, the value will be in heaven. Let us not return to the Lord empty handed. 

Years ago when the speaker was a youth, he dreamt a similar dream a few times. The clouds darkened. The scene was chaotic. It was the Last Day. He knew the people around him were True Jesus Church members. He saw True Jesus Church members transform one by one and rise to the sky to meet the Lord. He was waiting for his turn. After some time, his turn didn’t turn up. He kept praying, he was afraid he was rejected. But then he would wake up. He dreamt this 2-3 times over a period of time. He isn’t sure why he has this dream or what it means, perhaps he read Revelation too much or feels guilty about his sin. Nevertheless, the feeling he got from the dream was unsettling; being uncertain whether he would die in the Lord. After that, he made sure he didn’t turn down church work easily.

How would you feel on the Last Day when the Lord comes again, if He feels we are not worthy to be with Him? And when He meets us He says, “Depart from Me I do not know you.” It’ll be our greatest regret we can do nothing about. Many of us have worldly pursuits. But as Christians, we should pursue the blessing of dying in the Lord. Pursue holiness. Ensure we have treasure in heaven. 

Serving the Lord is really a blessing. God doesn’t need us because He’s the Creator of heaven and earth. But God gives us the opportunity that we may be able to lay up treasure in heaven. If we don’t serve Him, we can’t earn anything. It’s our duty to serve Him, because we love Him. 

If God has given us 1 talent, make sure we use it. If He has given us 2 or 5 talents, we should try to multiply them. So that when we meet Him in heaven the Lord may say to us, “Well done good and faithful servant. Come into the joy of the Lord.”

Gal 2:20
“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”
Paul no longer lived for himself. He didn’t fear death because he knew if he dies, he dies for Christ. He had fought the good fight. It’s a wonderful grace of God to be His children. Our sins have been remitted by His blood. We no longer live for ourselves but for Christ, because Christ lives in us. Pursue blessings to die in the Lord. So that on the day we meet Him, we will have no regrets. A crown of righteousness awaits us. May God help us keep His word in our hearts.
