 2 Cor 5:17
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation”
If we are in Christ, we are a new creation. In fact if we were asked what we think being a Christian is about, what would we say? The speaker wonders if we have thought about this question from time to time, or deeply. 

Oftentimes when people ask if we’re a Christian, we say yes. In a form, when asked which is our religion, we tick ‘Christian’.

But what is being a Christian about? What is it for? WHY are we Christians? We may say, “This is a trick question right? I know the right answer. I didn’t become a Christian for social purposes okay! I didn’t go for some benefits. I’m a real one! I’m a Christian because I want to be saved! I know I need to be a Christian to be saved! Being a Christian is being out of death, into life!” Thank God, that is right. 

We come to church because we want eternal life and recognise we need to be saved. But being a Christian goes beyond that. It’s not just about being saved. That’s very basic; that’s fundamental. If we don’t even get that, we’re missing the point altogether. 

But if we get that, can we stop there? And then we might say, “This is another trick question! I’m not just about being saved. I’m actually quite religious you know. I take my faith quite seriously one. You see COVID-19 I still come to church because Sabbath day mah. Must keep the commandments. I’ve been coming since I was a youth. I’m always here okay, rain or shine! And even COVID-19!” “It’s not just salvation, I’m actually very religious!”

Thank God. Yes we must keep the commandments and do what’s right. But being a Christian isn’t just about following the ‘rules’. Singaporeans are very good at following rules. Sometimes people laugh at us. No cars, red man, we still don’t cross. In many other places, people would have crossed the road already. 

But being a Christian goes beyond that. 2 Cor 5:17 says that if we are in Christ, we are a new creation. Many other verses also point us to this understanding as well. Remember Jesus told Nicodemus that we must be born AGAIN (John 3:3). What does that mean? When we’re baptised we’re born again - born of water. What does that mean?

If we remember how we learn our doctrines, Rom 6:3-6 records that when we’re baptised, we’re baptised into Christ. What happens when we‘re baptised into Christ? The Bible says we have died; the old man has died with Christ. And because of that, in baptism, we’re buried in Christ and raised in Christ. We’re raised a new man. That’s why it’s called born again. The old person has passed away dead and buried. 

If we’re true Christians, when we’re baptised, we’re born again. So we need to lead a newness of life. So yes, being a Christian requires us to keep the commandments of God, but a question we need to ask ourselves after being a Christian for many years is this: what about being a new creation, a new person? Have we indeed cast aside the old? Have we indeed started to embrace the new? Are we transformed? Something for us to really reflect deeply about. 

Because being a Christian is about becoming a new and better person. 

Rom 12:1-2
“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”

In particular in v2, Paul encourages us that we not only not be conformed to this world, but very importantly to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. So as a Christian we MUST be transformed. No longer that old person. Are we now a new person? Are we a newer person day after day of being a Christian?

Most, if not all, of us understand the full doctrine of salvation. Be baptised. Our sins are washed away. Our feet have been washed to have a part with Jesus. We partake of the Holy Communion, eat His body and blood, and have the life of Christ in us. We regularly keep the Sabbath. Many of us have already received the Holy Spirit. So yes, being a Christian is about being saved. And the Bible says receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving the guarantee of our inheritance. Some of us may not have received the Holy Spirit but we know after we’re baptised the Holy Spirit is a promise to us. 

But to many of us that have received the Holy Spirit, we pat our shoulders and say, “Relax.” “Wah you don’t know how hard I prayed. Finally saved already. Guaranteed already. Now I can relax.”

The speaker hopes we don’t do that. Receiving the Holy Spirit is not just about that only. It’s also to guide us into all truth. So we need to rely on the Holy Spirit to understand the truth better. 

“Yes I read the Bible everyday. I’m getting to know more and more! The Holy Spirit guides me!”
Thank God. 

But in line with this sermon’s theme, there’s another reason why the Holy Spirit is given to us. 

Titus 3:5-8
The Bible tells us that the Lord saved us through the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Spirit. The washing of regeneration is water baptism. We know the renewal of the Holy Spirit links to John 3:5 where one is born of the spirit. When our status has changed from sinner to son of God, the Holy Spirit is given to us not just as a guarantee which is basic, but to renew us; to become a new creation; a new man. Our nature, our person, has to change. And that is what Christianity is also about. It certainly is about salvation, about keeping the commandments. But sometimes we do not remember and realise it’s also about changing and renewing ourselves to be a better and better person everyday. 

Sometimes the speaker wonders: when we look at ourselves in the mirror physically, do we like what we see? He hopes so. Most times yes. If not we’d do something about it. If we don’t like that little hair sticking out at the back, we’d press it down. If that doesn’t work, we put some water. It stays down for a while but when it dries, it pops out of place again. If that doesn’t work, we put gel. If that doesn’t work, we wear a cap (many people who come out of Pulau Tekong start wearing caps).

We all want to look presentable and look good. What we think is not right, we want to make it look right. But if we have a mirror that can look inside, do we like what we see? 

When we lie down in bed at night just before we sleep, do we reflect on our day? What have we said today, who have we met today, what we said and did to them? “These people said and did things to me, how did I react?” Many things happen in our lives each day. If we can look into a mirror that can look inside, are we able to tell ourselves, “I’ve been and acted like a good Christian today."

Do we even reflect like that? That’s why it’s very important to lead a life of spiritual nurture. Come to listen to the word of God. In sessions like that, don’t fall asleep la. Listen. Reflect. The word of God is like a mirror! 

What kind of person are we? What was I? Have I changed?

In our prayer, these are things we can reflect on. The things we have done, the things we have not done. These are all good times for us to reflect on ourselves. Have we changed?

Sometimes it’s quite surprising, somewhat sad when the speaker is made aware of situations. “That’s not even how a human being would react, let alone a Christian; let alone a True Jesus Church Christian.” Why? Do we not understand the word of God? If we know the word of God, why would we behave like this? Of course we all have our weaknesses; we will have our times of weaknesses; none of us are perfect. So we’ll sometimes do/say the wrong things and make the wrong decisions. This is normal. But at least when we have done/said the wrong things and made the wrong decisions, we won’t be hardened in our hearts and not admit it to even ourselves. So when people encourage us and point it out to us, we don’t become defensive and certainly don’t become aggressive. That’s not what it’s like to be a Christian. 

Some Christians in the Bible will be covered, may we learn from these lessons. 
1. Complacent/indifferent Christians
1 Cor 5:1-2
“It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s wife! 
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you."
This was what Paul wrote to the Corinthian church. These weren’t unbelievers. These were believers!

In that time there were a group of people called the Gnostics. They believe that whatever they do in the flesh will never stain the spirit/soul inside. To them, anything material and physical is unholy and bad anyway. Interestingly, some people in the Corinthian church were also like that. They were members but their sexual immorality was not even done by people outside. 

This man was committing sexual immorality with his father’s wife! And it probably wasn't just one person, but a few. And even after doing so, v2 says they were puffed up and not mourners. Doing something wrong is bad enough, not being repentant is bad enough. But these people were PROUD of doing it. 

This is a big problem. These were complacent, indifferent Christians. They always think they can do no wrong. “Nothing is too hard me. Don’t worry it’s okay!” Do we have this kind of attitude in our faith? We have been Christians for a long time. “This small mistake? It’s okay.” Next time they’ll say it’s okay for big mistakes too. 

As a Christian we must ask ourselves if we are still the same in our nature. Do we care that we still have that thing that’s quite ugly inside us? Why don’t we change?

1 Cor 5:6-8
Paul told them their glorying was not good. After doing the wrong thing, they could still glory in it! “Don’t be so serious la Paul! Relax la.” But even if it’s a little bit, your glorying is not good. Don’t you know a little leaven can leaven the whole lump? If we’re truly Christians, we must remove that little thing. It might be different things for each of us. Take it out! Because if we don’t remove it, it becomes a foothold for the devil. And over time, a little leaven leavens the whole lump. It becomes too late. 

Matt 3:8-10
“Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”

These were the Jews who came to John the Baptist. They had this complacency. “It’s ok! We’re the chosen people of God! Salvation is in our grasp! Relax. We KNOW, hello! We know what God’s about. We know His commandments. We’re not Gentiles okay. We’re children of Abraham God specially called out!” They were missing the point. This was the complacency they had. Yes, they were children of Abraham. But because of that they didn’t lead their lives according to what was required. Their lives didn’t change. They were just chosen people of God in name but not in nature. That’s why John told them to bear fruits worthy of repentance. "Don’t just tell yourselves you’re children of Abraham. God can raise children of Abraham from stones." 

Don’t tell yourself you’re a durian tree - king of the fruits. But inside all full of worms. What’s the point of the durian tree if it’s not what it’s meant to be? But if it indeed bears good fruits, it indeed doesn’t take God’s grace in vain and will be received by God. 

We have been Christians for many years. Salvation? We get it! We have received the Holy Spirit. But have we changed?

We move on to the second group of people. They’re not that complacent, may not necessarily do wrong things.

2. Christians who are religious practitioners
Matt 6 was part of a long sermon Jesus was speaking. In v1 He says, “Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven.” v5 “And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.”

There were people who were religious practitioners. When it’s time to pray, they pray. In the synagogues. In the corners of the streets. And they don’t just engage in religious worship. They also do charitable deeds! They do good things. So it’s not like they’re indifferent or complacent. They do these things. But what’s the problem? They did it with the wrong motives. This was what the Pharisees were like during the time of Jesus. Did they have knowledge of the Scriptures? They did. In fact they knew the Scriptures pretty well. Did they know the law? They did. And they even went the extra mile to do charitable deeds. 

What was the problem? Even though they did these things, it was because they felt compelled. They did it for two things: (1) for others to see so that they may be praised, (2) it was just out of habit. Their motivations/heart had not been changed. 

In Matt 23 we see how Jesus rebuked them.
v2-3 “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.” 
Their basic underlying teachings were not wrong. These people KNEW what was right and were able to teach what was right. And Jesus says here we ought to do this. But what was the problem? Jesus tells us to observe, but don’t do according to their works (v3b). So the problem with them was that they said but didn’t do. That’s hypocrisy. 

v5 "But all their works they do to be seen by men."
Their motives were wrong. So Jesus rebuked them for being hypocrites. 

What are hypocrites? People who say but don’t do. Or do but with the wrong motive. That’s hypocrisy, because it didn’t come from a genuine sincere change in their hearts. And that’s why this entire chapter was full of rebuke to the Pharisees. “Woe to you scribes and Pharisees!” Jesus was trying to tell them not just to clean the outside but also the inside. 

Matt 23:23
“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.”

This is very clear. It’s not that the things the Pharisees did were unimportant or didn’t need to be done. Jesus says they ought to be done but they ought to have done it while ALSO doing matters that were even weightier!

Matt 23:25-26
“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also."

So these are the second group of people - religious practitioners. They know the rules very well and follow them carefully. But the inside hasn’t been cleansed or changed. So even if there appears to be right actions, the heart inside has not been righted. 

This is something we Christians need to be very conscious about. Take time to ask ourselves if we have actually changed. 

Recall the parable Jesus spoke of the Pharisees and tax collector praying in the temple. The Pharisee was praying, boasting about all the good things he had done. But the tax collector didn’t even dare to lift his head up. He was deeply reflective of the mistakes he had made, repenting and asking for forgiveness. Jesus was very clear who went back more justified. 

So if today we do the good and right things, we thank God for that. But we need to ask ourselves: when the test really comes, are we really good, kind people who have really changed inside? When there’s no rules, when what’s right and wrong is unclear, we do the right thing simply because our hearts have been changed. That’s a new creation. Not that rules and commandments are not important. But we no longer keep them because they’re written down in a rule book. We’re kind, good, helpful people not because the rule book says so. But because our hearts have been changed. We become like Jesus. 

3. Repentant Christians
Luke 19:1-10
Here talks about the time Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. There was a man called Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector and was very rich. He sought to see Jesus but couldn’t because there was a crowd and he was short. So he climbed up a sycamore tree because he knew Jesus was going to pass through. When Jesus passed, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” (v5)

Zacchaeus was a sinner. Everyone shunned him. They wouldn’t let him go forward to see Jesus. But he was determined to do so. Jesus could see his heart. So when Jesus walked by, he was up on a tree. Jesus looked up. Zacchaeus had the heart to seek Jesus. Jesus had the heart to seek Zaccheaus. 

When Zaccheaus heard what Jesus said, he was touched. He made haste to come down and received Him joyfully. The people around them complained when they saw this. "He’s gone to be a guest with a man who’s a sinner!"

This is interesting. These people around thought they were better than Zacchaeus. Physically they may seem better than Zacchaeus because they didn’t cheat people like he did. But in their hearts they weren’t pleasant people. They weren’t hoping for Zacchaeus to repent; for Jesus to change Zacchaeus. 

They probably thought: “Wah if only Jesus just by looking at Zacchaeus cause him to fall off the tree!”

In our righteousness, that’s sometimes how we think. We miss the point. Are we keen to prove our righteousness? Are we keen to prove the errors of people? Or are we keen to turn people away from their errors and save their souls? 

So these people complained. Jesus still went. What did Jesus see these people couldn’t?

v8 
Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.”
This was repentance. This is someone whose heart was genuinely touched and repentant, and the action he took was really out of the change in his heart. 

Then what did Jesus say?
v9 “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”

When he repented, his heart was changed. That’s when Jesus said, “Salvation has come to this house.”

So as we reflect on our journey of faith: we have been baptised. We know the word of God. We diligently come and attend Sabbath services. We perhaps serve God in our own ways. These are all good things. Please continue. These we ought to do without leaving the others undone. 

What are the “others"? To be truly a new creation. To have a genuine change in our hearts. Are we truly good people whose nature has been truly changed to be like Christ?
