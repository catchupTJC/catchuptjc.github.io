The previous sermons discussed how God is seeking for people to intercede and for the lost. Who else is the Lord seeking?

Acts 13:22  
After God rejected Saul as king, He sought a man after His own heart to be the next king. God chose David because he was a man after the heart of God. We have to emulate David, not to become a king but rather to be one after the heart of God. Because even a king may not be able to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. But a man after God’s heart definitely will. Let us ask God to help us become a person after His heart. 

How did David exhibit being after the heart of God?

## 1. David was after the heart of God with regards to his faith
1 Sam 17:36-37  
David’s shepherd life was typically peaceful and tranquil. But there were times of danger. In the face of lions and bears, David didn’t flee, because he wasn’t focused on the danger the bears posed on him. What was in his mind was the danger posed to the sheep. This was his responsibility as the shepherd - to protect the sheep. He relied on God for help, defeated the beasts and saved the sheep from danger. 

As Goliath defied the armies of God, the Israelites didn’t dare to fight after seeing how mighty he was. But David was reminded of the almightiness of God which gave him courage to stand up to Goliath. He said to Goliath, “You come with me with a sword and spear, but I come to you in the name of the Lord.”

We see the faith of David clearly here - in times of trials, he wasn’t focused on the dangers but God. He didn’t have fear but faith. That’s why David was a man after God’s own heart. 

Most of our everyday lives is peaceful. But there will be occasions where there is danger or disaster. Especially in this prolonged period of the COVID-19. People truly have started to panic. Some countries have resorted to lockdowns. While the Singapore government has not lock-downed Singapore yet, they have suspended religious services and entertainment places. This stirs up fear in Singaporeans. On the way to church, the speaker heard some uncles and aunties asking each other if they have stocked up. Perhaps a lockdown will come soon. This is a worry to us. 

A sister asked the speaker just before the service, “What are your thoughts concerning our current situation?” He asked, “Do you mean anything in specific?”
“More specifically, towards the measure of suspension of religious services.”
“It’s good. This is both a training and test for us. We cannot gather in church for service anymore but our worship towards God doesn’t end. The church has arranged for live streaming services. The speaker will speak the sermon in church. The members will remain at home and have service together. This is a good form of training for us.”

We are very accustomed to having service in church and not at home. Now without having the option of coming to church for service, will we still continue to have service? There is still the live steaming option now. But if one day this option is not available anymore, will we still be able to lead our families in worship/service? The speaker feels this is good training and an opportunity to introspect. Especially if we have family members who don’t really come for service. This becomes an opportunity to worship God together at home. 

Many healthcare workers have quoted the phrase: “We stay at work for you. You stay at home for us.”
It’s true that it’s safer for us to stay at home; see the doctor and isolate yourself if you feel unwell. 

But what’s more important is bringing our families to worship together. When we see so many who have been infected and so many who have died worldwide, should we not pray for them out of Christian love? We never know when it may be like that for us. We don’t need to be afraid of this, but what we should be afraid of is not knowing how to trust God. 

Jesus tells us to pray in this manner, “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.” Let us pray in such a manner in this trying time. 

Let us emulate the faith of David. In the face of danger and tribulation, don’t be fixated on death and fear, but focus on how to turn to and rely on God. 

## 2. David was after the heart of God in his battles
1 Sam 5:19, 22  
David had fought many victorious battles before this but wasn’t arrogant about his past victories. He continued to trust in God and carried out what was according to God’s heart. So before this battle, he inquired of the Lord on whether he should go up against them. If God gave the okay, then he would go. 

Even in his battles, David was after the heart of God. He didn’t do according to his will, but did according to God’s will. Before every battle, he would first inquire of the Lord. 

Before David fought Goliath, did he first inquire of the Lord? He didn’t. Because this was a question that didn’t need asking. It was clear it was according to the will of the Lord. David asked, “How can this Philistine defy the armies of the Living God? Can anyone rid the shame of Israel?” No one stood up. So David courageously took the first step. His goal was to remove this shame. David fought not for his own reputation but for the armies of the living God not to be ridiculed. 

David followed the heart of God in his battles. Likewise, our lives of faith are battles. Are we fighting for the name of God or for our names? There’re battles we know we need to fight but don’t. There’re battles we know we ought not to fight but we spend so much time on them. We engage in battles for our flesh. But actually we ought to engage in battles for God. 

Do we follow the heart of God in our battles?

## 3. David followed the heart of God in his service
2 Sam 6:3, 6-7  
David used new carts to transport the ark of God. It was out of good intention to use new carts, but this wasn’t according to the will of God. God intended for man to carry the ark, not for it to be transported on a cart. When the oxen that pulled the cart stumbled, the ark almost fell off. Out of good intention, Uzzah put out his hand to stop it from falling and was struck dead. God had already commanded that the ark cannot be touched by human hands.

Man chooses not to listen because they think it’s out of good will. Human beings think their good will supersedes God’s will. But how can man’s good will be better than God’s will? Is what we think is good TRULY good? What we see and consider is limited to that specific situation. That’s why we end up doing bad things with good intentions. 

By the time we realise our error, it’s too late. We need to reflect and examine ourselves. What we think to be good may not necessarily be good. Especially in our service to God, our good will shouldn’t supersede god’s. Does our good will go against God’s will? 

When David saw his error, he corrected himself. We see a man after the heart of God makes mistakes too. But he realises his mistakes and puts asides his own will after realising. 

2 Sam 6:14-15, 20-23  
When the people were welcoming the ark, nobody imagined David would take off his kingly garments, jingle with the people and dance amongst them. When his wife Michal saw this, she mocked him, “How glorious was the king of Israel today?” David replied, “it was before the Lord. I was a lowly shepherd. But today God has made me king of Israel. I’ve received so much more grace than any other servant. Should I not put myself even lower than all the other servants to praise and thank God?”

Michal reckoned as king of the nation, he was supposed to be above all. How could he dance among the people like one of the base fellows? She saw it as a big disgrace to not only his reputation but also his dignity. 

If one day God grants us with an elevated status/more wealth than others, would we think in the same way as Michal or have the heart of David?

Before God, we shouldn’t focus on how to maintain our reputation amongst people? Rather, put aside our own prestige and come together with God’s people to worship Him. This is a man after the heart of God. 

## 4. David was after the heart of God with regards to his offerings
1 Chron 29:14-15  
The earlier passages show David had offered A LOT. But here David said his offering doesn't count as much, because all things came from God. David said this because he understood if God didn’t grant him the opportunity, he wouldn’t be able to get what he had; if God didn’t sustain his life, he wouldn’t even be able to receive it. Since, shouldn’t we offer a small portion to Him? Why aren’t people able to offer willingly? Because they feel what they have earned is out of their hard fought efforts. They forget if they weren’t even alive, they wouldn’t even be able to work and gain this. 

Do not worry that by giving more, we end up with less. For those who earn a lot, they end up giving a lot away too because they have a lot. But for someone who earns $1000-$3000 struggling to bring up a family and making ends meet, they feel it’s harder. The poor might have the mindset that the rich should offer more. Of course if you’re going hungry, the church never forces offering. If you offer unwillingly, that’s not good also. 

Recall the widow who offered two copper mites. This was at the expense of a meal. She knew missing one meal wouldn’t cost her her life. But she knew if she didn’t repay God’s grace, it might. These two copper mites have moved many. 

Let us give thanks for His grace. He knows how much we have. We just need to put in our effort to help the church of God. Don’t worry you don’t have enough, the Lord will bless you in other areas. 

When Abraham had to leave his home, God promised him that his descendants would be like the stars of the sky and sand of the sea. 

Hannah gave up her son. This was after trying so hard to have a child. Why did she give her son up? She knew God would bless her in other ways and truly she gave birth to 3 sons and 2 daughters. 

Today when the church of God has a need, will we contribute willingly?

How David offered is also quite moving. God didn’t allow him to build a temple for Him. Most of us would think: Don’t let me build? Then don’t build lorh. 

Not David. He wasn’t fixated on WHO would build it. He saw this as God’s work, and put his heart into ASSISTING the building of the temple. This was an important aspect of David’s offering to God. 

This may happen to us. We truly want to help in this work. We may clearly be more capable than the one who was chosen to undertake the work. “Fine. Then I’ll fold my arms (袖手旁观) and not help anymore!” Such a mentality is not pleasing to God. 

Let us be like David. When we really want to do something for God but God doesn’t allow us to, we may feel very sad. But David didn’t sorrow, because he believed in God’s will and accepted God’s reason for not allowing him. The reason God gave was that his hands had shed blood. We may not be able to accept such a reason and talk back, “My hands have shed blood for who? For You right? I was a shepherd leh and you called me out and made my hands shed blood.”

David was a man after the heart of God. He respected and esteemed God’s will above his. It wasn’t that he didn’t have any opinions. Rather, it was that he was willing to lay aside his own to listen to God’s. 

May the Lord help us to grow like David to have a heart after God’s heart; seeking to do His will.
