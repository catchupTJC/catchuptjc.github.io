The transmission of COVID-19 has led to many crises. This is a great test for humanity. This is the first time in the speaker’s life he has experienced a global scale disease. This has also become a test for the various governments. If they don’t handle the situation well, it’ll pose a threat to their political power. The world also faces the impending economic crisis. The stocks have plummeted. The financial crisis has also brought many investors to the reality of being bankrupt. Even employees feel panic and fear at the possibility of retrenchment. What’s most terrifying is seeing people dying one by one. Many countries could never anti IA our this challenge to their healthcare system. Some have already collapsed. Some ministers in other countries are in tears of helplessness because they see their citizens die one by one. In the news, we see country after country undergo a lockdown. In Singapore, religious services have been suspended. This is good to contain the spread of the virus. 

We aren’t able to gather physically together, but we thank God through technology, we are able to have service together still. We can still draw near to the bosom of the Lord. 

When we’re able to come to the sanctuary of the Lord, we may feel a sense of pity that we aren’t able to gather. But it has also become an opportunity for us. Will we grow stronger in our faith to draw closer to the bosom of the Lord? At home, do we still maintain a heart of reverence? What is the state of our faith?

We need to understand that when we meet with challenges, whether in season or out of season, we ought to learn the word of God and draw near to His bosom. The virus will dissipate, but the word of God endures forever. 

Why must we draw near to the Lord’s bosom? It’s not that we shouldn’t be concerned about the crises in the world now, but they don’t pose a direct threat to our faith. Rather it’s when we’re overly worried over the things of the world that our faith is threatened.

Luke 21:34-36  
The Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples about the time He would come again. He mentioned the things that would happen - it would cause people’s hearts to be weighed down. That’s why He wants us Christians to be watchful. 

We often say we will naturally draw near to God out of fear in times of danger/crises. But in these verses, after Jesus mentioned many calamities, the people’s hearts were still weighed down by the cares of the world. We may not draw near to God but instead go further from Him. Take heed so we don’t lose our sense of wariness in times of enjoyment. Draw near to His bosom to prepare our faith. 

How do we draw near to His bosom? When our hearts aren’t weighed down by the cares of the world. That’s when we can pay attention to His words, voice and matters. The disciples then faced impending storms. The Lord Jesus came into the world to complete the way of the cross. There was one occasion where while He was about to be betrayed by one of His disciples, there was another disciple who drew near to the bosom of the Lord. 

John 13:25  
After John heard Jesus say someone would betray Him, he drew near to Jesus’ bosom. Why? Because he was concerned about Jesus. He had an intimate relationship with Jesus. He was one able to empathise with the Lord. He knew Jesus would be sorrowful. Judas would betray Him. Peter would deny Him thrice. He would be nailed on the cross. Who could understand the deep sorrow He had?

And Jesus wasn’t just sorrowful over Himself, He was concerned about the disciples’ lack of vigilance in the Garden. Jesus kept telling them to watch and pray (lest they enter into temptation). The spirit was willing but the flesh was weak. This was a threat to their faith.

John leaning into Jesus’ bosom reflects his concern for Jesus. Do we also draw close to the Lord today? When we’re able to come for service, do we come? When we’re not able, do we still show concern for the Lord?

John kept what the Lord said in his heart. If we’re able to remain watchful when we face perils in our faith, we’ll be able to remain in the Lord. 

When Jesus was arrested, the disciples fled. Yet John didn’t lose his faith because of this. Likewise today we need to show concern for the matters of the Lord. Understand that it’s a grace. Know the teachings of the Lord will strengthen our faith and enable us to not lose our vigilance. 

The Lord Jesus talks about the hearts of men in the last days. Firstly, people will sorrow over the matters of the world. Secondly, people will also enjoy persecuting us. Some will be drunk and carousing. These two realities will pose a threat to our faith, such that we lose our watchfulness and not be prepared. That’s why we draw near to the bosom of the Lord to hear His words so we will be watchful. 

John was concerned about the matters of the Lord. Jesus entrusted him with a special responsibility. 

John 19:25-27  
John stood by Jesus’ side; following the Lord closely. He was beside Him up to when He was nailed on the cross. John drew near to the bosom of the Lord. John stayed by Jesus’ side. Even though he had no power to save the Lord, he never forsook Him. He continued to stand by His side. 

The fact that Jesus could speak to him shows they were not far apart. As a man, Jesus had to take care of His mother. But His time was up so He entrusted John to look after His mother. This was such an important duty. Why did He entrust it to John? Because he was the disciple who drew near to His bosom; who stayed by His side; who continued to pursue the matters of the truth; who was trusted by the Lord. 

Are we a person who stands beside the Lord? Who understands the intentions of the Lord? When our environment is adverse, do we continue doing the duties our Lord has encouraged us with? Even though services are suspended, the church has continued to prepare for RE classes to preserve their faith. Lessons will still continue tomorrow because we want our children to still draw near to the bosom of the Lord and be concerned about His matters. Children are a heritage of the Lord after all. Have we preserved what is entrusted to us well?

As parents, let’s not look lightly upon online lessons. It is hoped you will allow your children to participate in lessons. Because the word of God is the bread of life, and the bread of life for our children as well. Have we faithfully preserved this inheritance given to us? 

A person who draws near to the bosom of the Lord is one who faithfully does his duties to the Lord. 

Even when times are bad, we ought to constantly pray and draw close to Him. That’s why Jesus reminds us to pray unceasingly. Even though we can’t come to church, we can still draw near through prayer. At home/work, let’s not grow slack. Just as Jesus instructed the disciples to watch and pray - in the garden of Gethsemane, before the pouring down of the Holy Spirit, etc. Jesus mentioned several times to watch and pray.

Why must we watch and pray?  
1. So we won’t be carried away by lusts  
2. So we can constantly draw near to God

Jas 4:7-8  
If we draw close to God, we’ll be able to flee from the devils. When we’re watchful, we’re able to cleanse our hands. We draw near to God for our own benefit and salvation. Sometimes we might neglect the dangers the evil one can pose to our faith. Sometimes because of our anxieties and slackness, he might snatch us from the bosom of the Lord. Recall in the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus taught the disciples “lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one”. 

1 Pet 5:7-8  
“Cast all your cares upon for the Lord for He cares for you. Be sober and vigilant because our adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion.”
This adversary can refer to anything that can snatch our faith away or cause it to weaken. 

The Christians back then were suffering persecution. Because they remained watchful, the Lord strengthened them so they count overcome various temptations. As Jesus walked the way of the cross, what He relied on was prayer. God sent an angel to strengthen Him. In our faith we also ought to pray constantly. Only then would we be able to draw near to the bosom of the Lord. It’s when we’re weak and powerless that we’re able to draw near to the bosom of the Lord. Those in the bosom of the Lord will be watchful because they’re confident the Lord will protect them. 

People who embrace the world will die in the world, and the world won’t embrace one who is dead. People die while pursuing money, some die in bitterness, some die full of complaints and worries, some in conflicts. Common amongst them is that they die in or because of the world. This shouldn’t be the case for Christians. Because we have this beautiful hope. The greatest pain is living without any hope, or only having temporary short lived hope in the world. When our time comes, all we strived for would be grasping for the wind. 

Have we prepared ourselves? Let us have this joyous hope. 

Christians still feel fearful, whether it’s of illness or death. Some fear death because they don’t know where they’re going. Have you ever imagined what you’d be like when you’re not part of this world? Would our non-existence cause any panic or fear? But we are able to maintain trust and draw near to the bosom of the Lord. 

Death is none other than the fulfilment of a joyous hope. Everyone of us fear losing our lives. But because the Holy Spirit is the guarantee we have our inheritance in heaven, let’s not be fearful, but have joyous hope and anticipation. However, this is contingent on whether we draw close to the bosom of the Lord. 

What does anticipation mean?
When the speaker was a very young child, his father promised to take him to the circus the next day. His heart was filled with joyous anticipation. At night he was so excited, he couldn’t sleep. The next day, they arrived at the circus and it was the first time he saw an elephant. He was 4-5 years old and the elephant was so huge. He was scared but in awe.

That’s what anticipation is like. 

If we can envision that the heavenly kingdom far exceeds anything in this world, even if we meet with hardships in life, if we hold on to our faith, we will have an imperishable life like our Lord Jesus. This is the hope we need to hold on to. 

We spend our entire lives wanting to lead a good life. We want to live well. But have we thought about our eternal life? Shouldn’t we put in the same amount of diligence to draw near to His bosom?

Even though the world has much uncertainties and we’re weighed down by worries, be like John who drew near to Jesus’ bosom and stayed by His side all the way. 

John was the last apostle to pass away amongst the 12. The rest were martyred. In Revelation, what John wished for was for the Lord to come. This shows how his heart longed to return to the bosom of the Lord. 

Faith doesn’t need to be related to how long our journey in this life is. What’s the greatest value in life? When we hold on to our faith till the end. If we only pursue things in the world, we may indeed gain many valuable things, but would it be a valuable life?

To draw near the bosom of the Lord, we need to get out of the busyness of life. The world continues to pursue what’s empty. We are the disciples of the Lord. He loved us and has chosen us. 

If we constantly listen to and stand by the Lord; be watchful and pray, that’s how we’ll be able to remain in the bosom of the Lord. 

The speaker met someone who left one of the greatest impressions on him. In Sembawang church, he met a simple man seeking the truth. He had contracted cancer. A church sister preached to and invited him to have further discussion with the church ministers. He accepted the invitation. The speaker was phoned and they went to preach. They talked about the Bible and the man always said “amen” to what they shared with him. He accepted baptism but after a while, his cancer became more severe and he had to stay in a hospice. The speaker visited him and asked how he was. He answered, “I feel at peace. I feel very close to the Lord Jesus.” His face showed no tinge of fear at all. Instead, he emanated the hope of returning to the Lord. The speaker left the hospice and later that night (at midnight), he received a call that he had passed away peacefully in the bosom of the Lord. 

This man had the greatest sense of hope because he was so sure and affirmed of the  faith he had.

It is hoped we will all be disciples loved by the Lord, and a follower who draws close to the bosom of the Lord.
