Jesus tells us we ought to learn from Him - His gentleness and lowliness in heart. We shouldn’t just learn from His character but also from the way He prays, because the prayers made by Jesus are pleasing to and heeded by the Heavenly Father. So we need to learn from how Jesus prays. 

## First prayer
Luke 3:21-22  
When was the heaven open to the Lord? When He prayed. The Heavenly Father opened the heavens and poured the Holy Spirit down. He said, “In You, I am well pleased.” We see Jesus’ prayer was pleasing to the Lord. What is the Heavenly Father pleased about?

Matt 3:13-15  
From the dialogue between Jesus and John the Baptist, we can see why the Heavenly Father was pleased. Why did Jesus need to get baptised by John whose baptism was one of repentance? Jesus didn’t need to repent but He got baptised to fulfil all righteousness. 

What does it mean to fulfil all righteousness?  
Deut 6:25  
Here tells us what it means to fulfil all righteousness - to be careful to observe the commandments of the Lord our God. 

John tried to prevent the Lord Jesus from receiving his baptism at first. But the Lord Jesus said, “It is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” In other words, it was fitting to obey the commandments of God. Hearing that, John didn’t try preventing Jesus anymore, because he knew this was in accordance to the commandments of God. 

John 1:32-33  
John said that it was God who sent him to baptism with water. What kind of water did John use? He didn’t follow the principles of the law which said to use waters from lavers. Nor did he use waters in water pots. Rather, he used waters in the rivers for his baptism. This was a more troublesome method but it was the commandment of God. No matter how troublesome it may be, God’s commands need to be adhered to. God also affirmed John’s baptism came from God. 

Luke 20:3-6  
These people didn’t dare to deny John’s baptism was from heaven, because the people believed John was a prophet of God and his baptism was in accordance to God’s command. That’s why they went to get baptised by John in the river, despite it being more troublesome. 

Today some believers question our mode of baptism. They agree baptising in the name of Jesus has biblical basis but not baptising in living water. The Bible only records the disciples baptised in the river but there’s no direct command to baptise in the river. They reckon baptising in the river is just a command of man; that it doesn’t matter which body of water one conducts baptism in. But Jesus made it clear that the baptism of John was from heaven, and it was conducted in the river. That’s why Jesus has to go to John to get baptised in the river. That’s why Jesus’ disciples also baptised people in the river. So today we too baptise people in the river; it has biblical basis. 

The Heavenly Father was pleased with Jesus’ prayer as He did in accordance to His commands. Even though John seemed to have reason to deny Jesus, when He understood it was according to God’s commands - “it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness” - he put aside his protests. 

1 John 3:22  
We hope to receive what we ask of God. But do we obey His commands and do what pleases Him in our life of faith? If we don’t do that which is pleasing to God, how can we ask Him to listen to our prayers? Let us insist on obeying His commands, that our Lord will heed our prayers. 

## Second prayer
Luke 5:15-16  
A great multitude came to hear Jesus speaking. Why did the Lord withdraw Himself into the wilderness to pray? Was it because He had performed many miracles and used up His powers? So He needed to ask God to restore His powers to conduct more miracles? Just like how when we say our battery is low and needs to restore. Jesus didn’t withdraw to recharge, but to avoid an electric shock. The people were zealous to come to the Lord to hear His word. But actually they had other hopes. Some hoped for Jesus to heal their sicknesses. Some hoped Jesus would become their king. 

John 6:14-15  
After Jesus performed the feeding of 5000 with loaves, the people came to take Jesus by force the make Him king. He departed into the mountains, not to hide but to pray. Jesus intentionally departed from these people so they wouldn’t surround Him; so that He wouldn’t be affected by thoughts of being king. He wanted to pray before God with a pure heart, and without desires. He wants to maintain His single mindedness towards God and the loyalty He has. 

Therefore the prayer made by the Lord here wasn’t to recharge but to prevent being electrocuted. Our prayers shouldn’t just be to recharge but also to refrain from being electrocuted. 

When people surround us and want to elevate us, are we able to retreat and come before the Lord to pray quietly?

When the names of others become more significant while we are still unknown; when the positions of others get higher while we are just standing by their side not even having a seat, will our heart be shaken or turn jealous?

Psa 17:14-15  
David realised a man’s life is likened to a dream, which is why man pursue wealth and fame. But he hopes when he awakes he’ll be able to see the face of the Lord. 

Many believers forget their lives are but a dream. When their lives come to an end, when they’re awakened from their dreams, then they’ll realise the fame and fortune they pursued in this world comes to nothing. They’ll face the judgement of God and it’ll be too late for regrets. 

We have to learn from the prayers of Jesus. Retreat to the Lord and pray. Ask God to preserve our soul so we won’t be electrocuted by the things of the world. Overcome the desires of the world so our souls can be saved. 

## Third prayer
Luke 9:28-29  
As Jesus prayer, His countenance changed. His robe became white and glistening. When we pray, is our countenance changed?

In an article, it said a group of students were very serious in their prayers and testified they saw visions and were filled with the Holy Spirit. They claimed their countenance became very bright. They were very excited but the person in charge of the camp said, “When Moses descended from the mount, he didn’t even know his face was shining. Everyone else witnessed it but Moses himself didn’t realise it. You’re so full of yourself when you’ve only seen some visions and had some experiences. Is the objective of our prayers just to boast of our experiences? Our prayers are not meant for our countenance to change or glow, but it’s for our hearts to change. That there’ll no longer be darkness but light in our hearts. Instead of having disappointment, we’ll have hope in our hearts.”

Just like the prayers of Hannah. She suffered much and was attacked. She didn’t know how to pray before God. She was sorrowful in her spirit. But after she prayed, her face was no longer sad. It went from sadness to smiling. 

Today we also face with various kinds of sorrows in our lives. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has it caused deaths, it's affected many people’s lives and work. It has disrupted the global economy. Many nations are glorified because of their wealth, strength and intellect. But upon the arrival of COVID-19, wealth, strength and intellect are devoid of strength. They don’t have the strength to overcome this virus. The finance minister of Germany was so stressed over this, he committed suicide. At this point in time, we realise what we really need is the power of God. 

Today we may also be infected by this virus. But we ought not to fear. The power of God is able to deliver us from these dangers. More importantly, God wants to save us and enter the heavenly kingdom. Because even if we aren’t infected by the virus, there’ll come a day we will die. And after we die, are we able to enter into the heavenly kingdom?

Therefore what’s important in a man’s life isn’t to pursue wealth, fame or intellect. What’s important in a man’s life is to have the power of God. Only God can protect and preserve our souls to enter the Kingdom of God. 

We hence ought to learn from the prayer of God; not to have our countenance changed but to have our hearts changed; to allow us to understand salvation is not for our bodies but for our souls; that our hearts will not be worried or fearful as long as we trust in God. 

Psa 42:5, 11  
“Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance. 
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.”

At some point in time, all of us have experienced being cast down and disquieted. When we’re cast down and disquieted, the psalmist doesn’t tell us to question God. “God why’re you letting these things to bring me down?” Rather, the psalmist asks us to question ourselves. “Why are you cast down, O my soul? You ought to rely on God. Why are you disquietened, O my soul? You ought to hope in God.”

In prayer, it shouldn’t be a time to question Him but to hope in Him. Prayer shouldn’t just to ask for things in our lives but to ask for our lives to be changed. Just like what’s written in Hymn 405. “When your heart is filled with sorrows and anger, did you think to pray? When you meet with sufferings and trials, did you think to pray? Praying rests the weary, and will change the night to day.” This hymn reminds us that we ought to learn from the prayers of the Lord. In our prayers we don’t ask for our countenance be altered or have our face shine, but rather to have a change in our hearts, so that we have the light of the Lord illuminate from our hearts; that we may have the hope and courage to continue forward along the way.
