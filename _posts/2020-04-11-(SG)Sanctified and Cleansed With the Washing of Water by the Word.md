Because of the spread of the virus, the skies are very quiet in Changi. Even the busiest airport in the whole world is quiet now. We no longer hear the sounds of plane engines in the sky. The streets are quieter. Carbon emissions have dropped significant. The reduction of human activities has resulted in much quiet. Likely, many of us have quietened ourselves down and reflected because we start to feel uncertain about our future, jobs and businesses. This is a change none of us hoped for. No one would think this a good thing. It’s as if the whole world has paused. The air is much cleaner. The carbon emissions of 7 billion people in the world is frightening. As human activities are reduced, the earth has the opportunity to rest. Some people say the carbon emissions of human beings are a pollution to the lungs of the earth. Its now able to have a breath of fresh air. And COVID-19 has stopped the pollution of the lungs of the earth. Even though the virus is bad, the air today is much cleaner according to satellite images. The earth is cleansed by the stopping of human activities. 

As Christians today, we start to slow down or stop our busy lives. We start to realise life on earth is so uncertain. There’re things that’ll happen out of our plans. It helps us to reflect on what is truly important in our lives. When we’re busy or engrossed in the world, we stop focusing on our spiritual pursuit. There’ll be much more changes in the world today. But on this day, the Sabbath, let us put our worried and cards aside and listen to God’s word. Because it’s only by the word of God can we be cleansed and be grown spiritually. 

The Bible talks about 4 types of washing/cleansing - water, word, spirit, fire. The purpose of washing is to cleanse a person. Some can obtain a new life; obtain edification. The main aim of all this washing is so we can be the holy people of God. 

## 1. Cleansing by water 
Eph 5:26-27  
The church is cleansed by the washing with water through the word. Paul uses marriage as an illustration of the importance of being clean/pure. A person must be cleansed because he is dirty. Material things can be cleansed with water. But the sins found deep in our hearts can’t be washed with water alone. But the precious blood of Jesus spiritually present in the water is able to. In baptism, through the water and blood of Jesus, we enter into the body of Christ. It is then through His spirit that we are cleansed. We who are called into this body of Christ are called into holiness and glory to be dedicated before God. Why would God need to wash the church with water through the word?

John 3:3-5  
The emphasis of these verses are water baptism and the Holy Spirit. A person cannot enter the Kingdom of God unless he’s born of the water and the spirit. Baptism reconciles us with God that we may meet Him face to face. Water baptism is very important in Christianity as it has to do with our salvation. One cannot see the Kingdom of God unless he’s born again. 

Some Christians say water baptism has nothing to do with salvation and is only symbolic; that it’s more a custom created by the Jews. They say the Bible is split into different periods and one need not adhere to what is said in a certain period since we are in another period. They believe a Christian need not be baptised to be saved.

But the Bible tells us water baptism is very important. It is by the water through the word that we are cleansed. Faith is indeed important. But we need to have faith and also keep God’s words. We cannot say that we have faith and nullify God’s words. 

Some people ask, “Wasn’t the thief on the cross saved without getting baptised? Wasn’t he saved by faith?” Indeed he was saved by faith. It was impossible for him to come down from the cross for baptism. At that time, Jesus had more shed His precious blood either. It was an exceptional situation. But after Jesus resurrected, did Jesus not command His disciples to baptise people? If we are not in the same predicament as the thief on the cross, we should keep Jesus’ commands to be cleansed by the water and the word. We can’t just focus on faith and neglect the word of God - unless a person is born of the water and the spirit, one cannot enter the Kingdom of God. 

As long as you’re a human being, regardless of whether you’re a Jew or Christian, you need to get baptised. Baptism is not just a custom of the Jews. The Bible tells us we cannot meet God unless he is sanctified. If we aren’t cleansed before God, can we obtain salvation?

1 Pet 3:20-21  
Elder Peter quoted Noah’s ark to explain the importance of baptism. He tells us baptism is associated with our salvation. It’s not merely the removal of filth of the flesh but a pledge of a good conscience towards God. 

Heb 10:22  
Through baptism, our guilty conscience is cleansed. When a person sins, the sin is unseen. No one else may know about that sin. Yet, it exists deep in our hearts, and our conscience knows about it. When a person undergoes baptism and rises from the water, he might feel the feeling of liberation from sin. His conscience is no longer guilty before God. He may feel lighthearted. 

This cleansing of baptism guides and helps us in our journey of life. When we’re weak and sin, admit our sins before God, repent, and the blood of Jesus continually washes us. 

There’re two extremes of Christians. One extreme feels that it’s no big deal after sinning; they look down upon the death and blood of Jesus Christ. The other extreme is too sensitive and feels they cannot be forgiven of their sins. As long as we have not committed mortal sins, we need to confess before Jesus Christ and repent. Put in effort to grow in our faith. Today we ought not to wilfully sin. When we do sin and don’t consider the heavy price paid by Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that if we wilfully sin, we step on the precious blood of Jesus. The implication of such sins is scary. One would be subject to greater judgement. It’s important for us to rely on the word of God to sustain our faith. To pursue further growth, we need to bear more fruits for the Lord Jesus Christ; to pursue holiness; to understand spiritual nurture is important. 

## 2. Cleansing by the word 
John 15:3, 17:17  
Jesus Christ tells us His truth can sanctify us. As we read the word of God and listen to God’s words, let us not just stay at the stage where we learn it as knowledge alone. If the word of God is able to cleanse our hearts, why are some of us still weak and sin? If God sanctifies us through His word, why are we still disobedient?

People of the world may not commit big sins/crimes. Christians are not people who love the world, but the word of God doesn’t seem to be able to strengthen us. Many of us feel laden with worries, cares and burdens. On the other hand, when some Christians are put in difficult situations, their faith is unwavering and are still able to bear fruits. Why do we see people who listen to the same word of God behave differently? Because the nature of their hearts is different, resulting in a different response. 

Matt 13:3-6  
These verses tell us about the parable of the sower. The sower went out to sow seeds (i.e. preach the word of God). Each ground/heart had a different response. When seed fell on the first ground by the wayside, the birds came and ate it. It represents people who cannot accept the word of God and so it is taken away from him. For the second ground, the seed sprung up quickly but because the ground was shallow, the plant withered when the sun came out as it had no roots. It represents people who accept the word of God readily but fall because of hardship. For the third ground, the seed sprung among thorns. The word that take root in the person’s heart, but Matt 13:22 tells us the worries of this life and deceitfulness of wealth choked the plants to death. This reminds us of Jesus’ warning. The worries of this life can divert our attention from the coming of Jesus Christ. The fourth type of ground was good ground; the person understood the world and bore fruit manyfold. 

The first type of person did not believe. The second had faith without roots - he believes for a while but gives up. The third had faith and roots, but was choked by the cares of the world. The fourth bore fruit. 

Some people have anxiety disorders. Why? Because their hearts are burdened and they cannot focus on the word of God. 

We need to be watchful as Christians and not be bogged down by all these worries in life. Why do we have depression? Why can’t the word of God enter and strengthen our hearts? Why can’t we relieve ourselves from worries?

A psychologist says a person able to eat, sleep and move around should be able to have a healthy life without excessive concerns and worries. It sounds easy but many of us can’t do it. Why? Because we’re too busy. We have too many stressors in our lives. We have too many self-expectations lain on ourselves. These may be root causes for why we suffer from depression. 

Matt 6:31-33  
Jesus tells us not to worry about our lives. The Lord Jesus Christ will watch over us. Sufficient for each day is the trouble of its own. Why does Jesus teach us to live day by day? As human beings, we are limited by our capability of worrying. If we keep thinking about and worrying over it, our mind cannot rest. 

Doctors today would also tell us these hormones will continue stimulating your mind. Even if we visit the psychiatrist in the world, he’ll likely say the same thing: rest, don’t think too much. 

Some people who are perfectionists fall into this trap. Having too many and too high expectations of ourselves creates unnecessary stress. We become afraid of criticism. When we cannot accept failure, this may happen to us. Actually all it takes is for us to lower our expectations of ourselves. But this is the very thing we can’t let go of. Jesus tells us each day has troubles of its own. One danger of the last days is that human beings have many worries in this life such that they aren’t able to spare attention to the coming of the Lord. They’re so concern with their thoughts that they can’t consider the Lord’s second coming. 

People who suffer from anxiety disorder fear their life has no meaning. But Jesus tells us not to worry and fear; that there’s indeed meaning to life. Life doesn’t end when our physical self dies. Our Lord will resurrect us. There we will find the meaning of a more abundant life. There’ll be no more fears and tears. He’ll be there to personally comfort us. 

When Elijah’s life was threatened by Jezebel, he was afraid and ran. He hid in a cave. Because he had such a grim expectation of himself, he wanted to die. He didn’t think that the Lord would give him more strength and require of him to continue this journey. Can we see how much our God cares for us? Listen to His word and let His words relieve us from the worries and cares of this world. 

Our concern is less that we have enough food to eat. Rather, it is the thirst we experience deep in our souls. 

Amos 8:11-12  
Man does not hunger for physical food, but for the lack of the word of God. Man searches far and wide but can’t find it. 

The northern kingdom Israel sinned against God. When the enemies came before their gates; when calamity was present before their doors, why couldn’t they not find the word of God? Because they were unwilling to change themselves, accept and receive the word of God. 

The word of God wants to cleanse us to help us bear more fruit. 

A brother suffered from depression before he became a preacher. He used to live in a world of his own. He couldn’t let go of many things. After coming to the True Jesus Church and believing in Jesus Christ, he understood the word of God. He read the Bible daily. He meditated on the word of God daily. He told the speaker, “My depression causes me to be very fixated on my issues. It’s a very negative thing. But I try to reroute it.” He change his fixation to the word of God. He focused on God’s words. He was cured of depression without taking medicine. He then applied to be a preacher to preach the word of God. He still bears fruits today. 

The word of God is able to cleanse us and help us to bear fruit. 

Everyone of us have different thoughts towards a cup that’s half filled. A positive person would think: at least I still have half a cup of water to drink! A negative person would think: I have so little water left to drink!

God cares about our physical wellbeing. God wants to cleanse the church by the water through the word. God watches over our hearts and wants to liberate us of our cares and sins, so we may be able to bear more fruits. The word of God is our dependence; it makes us stronger. 

While we have to remain at home during this period, do we look at the Bible or do we look more at our phones? Reading the Bible is an activity that can help our faith. With a gentle and meek heart, let’s accept the word of God. The word of God is able to save our souls. 

Now that the church has no more activities, what can we do? An internet ministry is going on. Youth services are also online. There’re call visitations. We have group prayers at night. Such that we do not cease to learn the word of God. The word of God is the sword of the spirit. After we’re cleansed by the water and the word, we’re able to be sanctified and meet our Jesus Christ life and holy. When we go into the eternal timeline and the church becomes the bride of Jesus Christ, baptism and the word of God will be our recipe to victory.
