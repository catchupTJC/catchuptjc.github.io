This afternoon, it was announced that the Circuit Breaker will be extended by 4 weeks. We will be cooped up in our homes for an even longer period of time, might experience what Rahab experienced as she was cooped up in her home waiting for the Israelites attack.

Biblical records of Rahab are in Joshua 2 and 6. Joshua 6 is where Jericho fell but Rahab and her family were saved. Rahab was a woman of not so noble profession. Only Rahab and her family were spared because of her faith, according to the New Testament authors “Rahab’s faith brought salvation to her and her family”.

Jas 2:25  
Rahab was saved because of her works in hiding the spies. These works came about because of her faith in God. That’s what the author of Hebrews says as well: *“By faith, the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.”* (Heb 11:31)

## What can we learn from Rahab’s example of faith?

## 1. Faith comes from hearing
Joshua 2:9  
We know that she received the spies. But **why** did she receive these spies? The words of Rahab showed she had faith and belief in the true God of Israel. But how did she know about the God of Israel? How did she come to have this faith?

Joshua 2:10
*For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.*
How Rahab came to believe/develop her faith was because of what she heard. The first thing we can learn from Rahab is that faith comes from hearing. How did Rahab hear? Different people hear differently; Rahab’s faith blossomed after hearing. 

v10 describes events that are more than 40 years apart. She mentioned how the Israelites defeated Sihon and Og; this happened before they crossed the Jordan River. Og was a giant king; to have been destroyed would’ve been big news. It’s no wonder Rahab heard of it. But somehow she also heard of the the Israelites miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, which happened when they first departed from Egypt 40 years ago. When Rahab heard about this and combined these two incidents together, she must’ve wondered how the Israelites were able to get out of Egypt and cross the Red Sea. She didn’t just take it as a fable. After careful reflection, she came to the conclusion that this God was the true God of heaven and earth; the God of the children of Israel. So she wanted to align herself with the Israelites and their God. 

From here we learn faith comes from hearing. What implications does that have for us today?

The first implication: we have to take note of what we hear. How do we hear sermons and the gospels? Different people hear differently. Other people in Jericho also heard about what God did for the Israelites. But their response was of resistance and terror. It was because of fear that the king of Jericho sent men out to look for the 2 spies sent by Joshua. Their hearing didn’t lead to an increase in faith, but a rejection and resistance against God. In a way, their hearts were just like seed that had fallen by the wayside, eaten by the birds of the air. But Rahab was very different. She thought deeply about what she heard. Her heart was like the good soul able to produce fruits. 

Take note of what we hear. When we listen to sermons, do we think, reflect, or just allow it to pass us by?

The second implication: if faith comes from hearing, then we must be preachers of the word so others can hear. 

Rom 10:14-17  
*How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:
“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace,
Who bring glad tidings of good things!”
But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.*
If faith comes from hearing, we must think about the people around us. Family. Friends. Have they heard the gospel through us? Have they even had the opportunity to consider matters of salvation? It’s our duty as Christians to pass the message of salvation so others may have the chance to believe and be saved. 

What can we learn from Rahab’s faith?

## 2. Rahab’s faith led to the salvation of her household 
If we look at the reaction of Rahab, after saving the spies and expressing her faith in the God of Israel, the next thing she asked for is found in Joshua 2:12-13. 

When Rahab concluded the city of Jericho was doomed to the destruction by God; that the people of Jericho were up against God and His people, her immediate thought wasn’t just about her own safety but also to secure salvation for her whole family. 

Today we have heard the truth, but are we anxious for our family members and the people around us, especially when they have yet to receive salvation and come into our church. Is this a matter of highest priority to us? Are we prepared to try all ways and means to bring the truth to them?

Rahab’s faith led to the salvation of her whole household. 

Look around you this evening. Who’s seated with you? Who’s under the same roof as you? Who’s enjoying the worship of God, studying the same words as you? Are there others you love who should also be with you in the safety of your home, enjoying the worship of the true God? Not just having physical security from the virus but also spiritual security from death?

Two Sunday ago, the youths had an interesting discussion: how can we continue the work of evangelism when we are locked physically in our homes? Some youths reflected that in this period of time, it may be even easier to preach the gospel. Because people want to seek security and a peace of mind due to the situation. At the same time, people generally have more time to reflect on life. Because we started to stream services, it’s easier to invite our friends to join today. If at this juncture of time, we know of family members who need the gospel and salvation, now’s a good time to preach. Don’t think it’s harder to preach during this difficult time, it’s even easier to preach today. 

This coming Sabbath, the sermons, while not totally evangelistic in nature, are suitable for Christian friends. 

We learn from how Rahab loved her family. Because of her faith, her family was saved. Do we love our family? We need to keep them in the house of God. If they’re not already in the house of God, we must bring them to the house of God. 

What can we learn from Rahab’s faith?

## 3. Rahab’s faith was put into work/action
Faith isn’t just a sense of feeling that you’re willing to do something. It must become an action. 

When Rahab pleaded for the deliverance of her family and herself, Joshua 2:14 is the response of the spies. *”Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the Lord has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."*

The salvation of Rahab and her family was not without condition. The spies stated their condition: she and her family could not tell of their business to anyone. 

There were a few more conditions in v17-20.  
*“We will be blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear, unless, when we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household to your own home. So it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him. And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.”*

The spies laid out 3 conditions for Rahab to fulfil to be saved. Firstly, they weren’t allowed to tell anyone of the business the spies had. Secondly, Rahab had to tie a scarlet cord to the window of her house. Thirdly, all her family must be found within her house when Jericho is taken. If they exit, their blood would be on their heads. The scarlet cord was to indicate where Rahab’s house was to the people of Israel. Very strict conditions. The scarlet cord is often referred to as the blood of Christ. By extension, staying in the house of Rahab represents entering the house of God and being protected by the blood of Christ. 

If we think what we are feeling today because of the situation; when we see our loved ones not sniffing or coughing and safe, and translate that sense of security to being in God’s house safe and secure from the destruction of our souls, that’s something to think about. Let’s think about what Rahab did **immediately** after hearing all these conditions. 

v21 tells us she immediately put up the scarlet cord at the window. Rahab did what she could do immediately because of obedience. Her faith was one that was put into action/words. That was what saved her and her family. 

When we hear about certain things which are commanded by God, we should do it immediately and not procrastinate. 

## 4. Her faith is one that is enduring 
Amongst the aforementioned 3 conditions given to Rahab by the spies, tying the scarlet chord was the easiest thing to do. The other conditions were dependent on her family as well. They must first believe and gather within her house. They must believe enough that it’s better to be on the side of God rather than the side of the people of Jericho, so they won’t leak out the information. This is more difficult. It’s easier to take action on your own. It’s much harder to change someone else’s mindset. But the faith of Rahab helped her to convince her family and save them all. 

Think from her perspective: she needed to ensure her family members didn’t leak the information out. 

For starters, she would have to convince her family members of the coming destruction of their city, and that they would only be saved if they stayed in her house. This isn’t easy. If we compare her to Lot, who had a pretty similar case where he was asked to escape the city of Sodom before it was destroyed, while Rahab was told to stay in her house while the city was destroyed; when Lot tried to convince his sons-in-law that the city was going to be destroyed, they didn’t believe and stayed behind. It’s not easy to convince your family members of the coming destruction and salvation in the house of God. But Rahab’s faith and love enabled her to do so much, she managed to convince her family. 

Besides convincing, preparations needed to be made for her parents, siblings, children, to all stay in the house. 

We’ve stayed at home for 2 weeks already. We would better appreciate what Rahab had to do. She had to prepare for all her family to stay in her house for an unspecified number of days. She knew the Israelites would come to destroy the city, and if any were outside the house, their blood would be on their own heads. But she wasn’t told **when** the attack would come. She wasn’t told how the attack would happen either. All she could do was to make preparations and keep the family in this house. Imagine the logistical planning she had to go through. Our thoughts as we stay at home: “Enough food? Enough groceries to cook to minimise time spent outside the house?” Rahab too must’ve thought how to minimise time going out, and having enough food at home. 

With regard to the unspecified amount of time she had to wait until the attack happened, it probably would have taken some time. By a miracle, it would’ve taken a week; if not, it might’ve taken a month. It would have taken 3 days for the spies to cross the river back to Joshua, as they were told to wait 3 days for the people from Jericho who pursued them to return back (Joshua 2:22-23). Then when the Israelites crossed over River Jordan to the western side, Gilgal, it was on the 1st month of the 10th day (Joshua 4:19). Then the males were circumcised at Gilgal. It takes time to recover from there. Based on Oxford University Hospital’s website, it takes a month to go back to normal activities after undergoing circumcision (Joshua 5:8). Joshua 5:10 also records the Israelites partook of the Passover for the first time in Canaan, which is on the 14th day of the 1st month. If the people miraculously recovered quickly from circumcision, they’d take fastest 7 days to reach Jericho, taking into account the 3 days the spies took to come back. But likely they took some time to recover so it was likely they took around a month to reach Jericho.

Imagine being cooped up in your house for a month - which is what we’re doing now. Not knowing when the Israelites would be coming, just based on the words of the spies, Rahab had the faith to wait. When the Israelites finally came, Rahab and her family might have rejoiced for salvation was near. But what they observed was no siege vehicle. No attack. Just the armies silently marching one round. That was day 1. At this juncture, if one’s faith wasn’t strong, one might wonder if this was real. The Israelites weren’t attacking but just silently walking one circle. The second day, the same thing happened; they circled once. Would we be able to hold on to our faith and endure that surely God’s promise will be kept? This would continue to the 7th day where it was a bit different. Instead of circling once, they continued circling, until the 7th circling where they shouted and blew the trumpets, and the walls came crumbling down. 

Their faith endured. In between the days, there were no signs of God’s working and they could only wait patiently. But when God worked, it was so clear. Surely Rahab and her family must’ve felt a sense of relief that their faith was not for naught. Finally they were able to exit from their house, having been cramped up for a significant period of time. 

Faith cannot be present only for a while. Faith like that of Rahab and her family was one that endured. 

Often in life we don’t know the timing of God. We can only believe in the promise of God. We don’t know when God will act but we must hold on to that belief. It is true for those of us asking for the Holy Spirit. The promise of the Holy Spirit is sure and given to us. But **when** we will receive Him is not mentioned to us, just like how Rahab and her family did not know when Jericho would fall. Continue praying even if there is no clear sign. Continue believing because God will definitely act. Whether for the Holy Spirit or for God’s protection. 

## Summary/Conclusion
Let’s learn from Rahab and her faith. Rahab’s faith came from hearing. How do we hear the gospel and sermons? If faith comes from hearing, have we preached the gospel, especially to our household, because faith leads to the salvation of households? Faith must be put into action/works. It’s not just for a little while; it’s faith that must endure. 

May God help us.
