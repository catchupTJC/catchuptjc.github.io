From the record of Acts 16:16-22, we will consider three points:  
1. What is important in our ministry?  
2. What obstacles happen along the way?  
3. What are the persecutions?  

Acts 16:16. 
When Paul arrived in Philippi, he went to the place of prayer. He did similarly when he arrived at other cities. In the midst of missionary work, Paul always prayed, and this goes to show how prayer is important in our ministry. We cannot say we are too busy with divine work and therefore don’t have time for prayer. 

Psa 127:1  
*“Unless the Lord builds the house, they labour in vain who build it; unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.”*

Matt 14:22-23  
After Jesus was busy with the work of God, He went to the mountain to pray. This shows how we must MAKE time to pray, and not just pray when we are free. We need to make effort to SET ASIDE time to pray. Through prayer, we can draw strength from God. 

A preacher was sent to pastor a church. They were lukewarm. Even though they were kind, their evangelistic work was lacking. The work of the preacher was difficult, but what is impossible for man is possible for God. We must turn to the Lord God to move the hearts of men. He decided to organise morning prayers in church for everyone to come together to pray. On the first day, he was the only one, but that didn’t discourage him; he continued. After a some weeks, a few members joined him, perhaps because they felt bad. But after several prayers, they felt very edified by them and invited other churches members to come too. Slowly, more people joined in the morning prayers. Some even took a bus for 1h to come to church to pray before they went to work. We thank the grace of God that after prayers, truthseekers started to come and even those baptised who had not come for a while started to come. Prayer guides us to have a direction in our work, opens the hearts of listeners, and gives us boldness to preach. 

Acts 16:16  
A slave girl that was demon possessed brought her masters profit by fortune telling. 

Lev 19:31  
We should not consult mediums because they are the work of the evil one. 

We say that while we are in the world, Satan  works to deceive us. But how about in church? While Paul and Silas were on the way to the temple, the demon possessed girl followed and harassed them. 

1 Pet 5:8  
*“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”*  
Satan is waiting for every opportunity to pounce on us and deceive us. He waits for a time we’re not vigilant. We need to be watchful in prayers at all times. 

Acts 16:17  
The slave girl was able to proclaim that Paul and Silas were servants of the Most High God.

Mark 1:21, 23-24  
These demons also acknowledged God and that He would destroy them. But this knowledge didn’t lead them to repent.

2 Cor 11:14-15  
Satan can transform himself into an angel of light, and his ministers transform themselves into ministers of righteousness. He’s waiting to deceive and devour us, just as he transformed into a serpent to deceive Eve; we hence have to be very vigilant. 

Acts 16:18  
Even though the slave girl proclaimed truly that Paul and Silas were servants of the Most High God, she was not an appropriate minister of the gospel. 

It was after some days that Paul, greatly annoyed, commanded the evil spirit to come out of the slave girl. This has God’s timing in it. 

Eccl 3:1  
*“To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven.”*  
We need to ask God for wisdom to handle things in its time, not ours. 

Acts 14:8-15  
When Paul and Barnabas healed a cripple from birth, the people thought they were gods. But Paul was very clear in his purpose to lead them to the living God. Sometimes we are overtaken by the praises of men, and are not able to see the schemes of Satan. This is something we must be careful about. 

Matt 16:23  
When Jesus spoke about His imminent crucifixion, Peter tried to stop him, resulting in Jesus saying, “Get behind Me Satan!” Jesus wasn’t saying Peter was Satan, but that because he didn’t set his mind on the things of God, he hindered God’s work.

When we set our minds on the things of men, we may be hindrances to God’s work. 

The evil spirit in the slave girl was a hindrance to God’s work, so Paul cast it out. 

We thank the grace of God that we have the power to cast out demons. In Batu Pahat, there was a demon possessed girl. There were no ministers there but the members gathered together to pray for her. Thank God after several days of prayers, the demon was cast out. 

After demons are cast out, does it mean things will be “happily ever after”?

Acts 16:19-22  
Even after the evil spirit was cast out from the slave girl, Paul and Silas did not have peace. The masters of the slave girl who were profiteering off her fortune telling abilities were very angry and falsely accused them, causing them to be thrown into jail. They were blind to the kindness and healing of the slave girl. 

We will not always have peace in this world...

Matt 10:16  
*“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.”*

1 Pet 3:14  
*”But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. ‘And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.’”*

...but we need not be troubled, because we know we are suffering for righteousness’ sake. We shouldn’t be so concerned about whether we will be persecuted, but rather be more concerned about whether we are doing the will of the Lord Jesus Christ.
