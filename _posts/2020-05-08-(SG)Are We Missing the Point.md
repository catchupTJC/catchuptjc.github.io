News comes to us through social media and these news and information tend to self-enforce our interests as our search engines know our previous searches. The algorithm will to prioritise certain news they know we're interested in so that the more we use platforms, the more we’re sucked into it; this is why people are sucked into extreme ideologies. We need to be careful of not only the information we receive; not just whether it is true or false but also even if it’s true, we have to know how we can conclude from the news because our interpretation and conclusion will shape our outlook in life. 

It’s possible sometimes we may miss a point as we interpret and conclude and that’s why it’s important for us to ask this: are we missing the point? 

The speaker would like to share a joke for illustration: 
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson went on a camping trip. After dinner and a bottle of wine, they prepared to sleep. A few hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his friend, “Watson, Watson, look up to the sky and tell me what you see!”

He replied, “I see millions of stars”

“What does that tell you?”

Watson pondered for a minute, “Astronomically, there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Logically, I can deduce that the time is a quarter past 3. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and we’re small and insignificant. Meteorically, we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does that tell you, Holmes?”

Holmes was silent for a minute and spoke, “Watson, you fool! Someone has stolen our tent!” 

From this speech we can tell that while Watson’s interpretation was valid, he missed the point. Sometimes it may be harmless like this situation; they’d just feel cold at night. But sometimes wrong interpretations can be much more deadly. When we miss a point, it can be a life and death situation. 

For example, there are those during this period who ignored the SHN measures. They think that they’re not afraid of the disease and hence conclude that they can do whatever they want because after all it’s their own life. Even if they were to get the disease, it was their own life and they’d bear the responsibility. However they failed to recognise that the point wasn’t in just their own life. If they were infected, they’ll affect their immediate family. They will also not just affect their immediate family but also cause a strain to the already busy medical personnel. It’s important therefore for us to not miss the point especially when it comes to matters pertaining to life and death. 

When Jesus was in the world, He corrected many missing the point; they either misinterpreted wrongly or missed what’s important. We’ll study these examples today. 

## Example 1
This incident will tell us how we should react when a man-made or natural disaster occurs. This incident happened when a tragic news story was reported and we see Jesus’ response. We read Luke 13:1-5:  
*1 'There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
2 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things? 
3 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. 
4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem? 
5 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”’*

In the middle of Jesus’ preaching, someone brought up that Pilate had killed some Galileans. News like these are likened to man-made disasters today. What were the bearers of these news expecting Jesus to comment on?

There are 2 possible groups of people:  
**1. They heard Jesus’ interpretation of discerning the times and hence concluded that these events were times for revoke repressing Roman rule.**  
“Pilate, this evil gentile, killed the Galileans who were sacrificing to God!” They wanted Jesus to lead as the king to bring about political freedom for the Jews. Such people may have expected Jesus to condemn Pilate and then start a revolution. But often people who think in this camp tend to believe that they’re Jews, ascendant of Abraham and God’s people and therefore deserving of special grace; when there’s a revoke they’ll overcome and be led to victory. 

**2. These people wanted to trap Jesus because if Jesus were to condemn Pilate they can raise Him as a revolter and get Him captured by the government.**  
One group focused on Pilate as the evil and the other was focused on Galileans. Jesus came from Nazareth, which is a part of Galilee. His disciples were also mostly Galileans. These people when they commented about the situation wanted Jesus (who knew more about the Galileans) to condemn those Galileans who were slain, “It’s because of the great sins of these Galileans, that’s why they’re killed!” From this point of view it seems as though God used Pilate to punish the Galileans. Whatever the reason that drove these people, Jesus’ response corrected their thinking. Jesus wanted to direct those who survived the disaster to the main point, which is in v2:  
*And Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?*

In v3 Jesus stresses on what the people should be doing:  
*I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.*

In v4 we see Jesus cite another example of a tragedy:  
*Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?*

We’re not sure what caused the tower in Siloam to fall but it could be a tragedy that came about from natural disasters. 

But through this tragic event Jesus reiterated the same point: were these who died greater debtors than you all? Unless you repent, you will also perish. 

It is natural when faced with great sufferings for people to ask the question, “Why?” Especially when this event is a national or international event and people want to assign responsibility or blame on somebody. Some would also think that the people who perish in the disaster would’ve been particularly sinful. When you conclude like this, then the logical reasoning must be that God directed these punishments on those people. 

While it’s true that God in certain cases uses pestilence as punishment (they’re in the Bible), the fact is that it’s not always the case that the people who perish in disasters are punished for their greater sins than those who survive. What’s more important and always applicable in all situations is the point that Jesus wants people to realise, that is the main point: God doesn’t want those who survived to speculate why the disaster happened. He also doesn’t want us to assign responsibility and blame people. 

What God wants His people to do in great tragedy is for the living to introspect and examine one’s own condition. Rather than commenting on whether Pilate, the people who died, or the 18 killed in the tower in Siloam were wrong, Jesus directed the attention to the people who were alive. Unless they repent, they too, shall perish. 

Today it goes without saying that we’re in the midst of going through tragedy but for us who’re able to hear this message today means that we’ve survived and are alive. Are we introspective? Have we repented? What was the main point Jesus was trying to drive at that when disasters occur, it’s only right for the survivors to introspect? Jesus expanded on the point on repentance from v6-9:  
*6 'He also spoke this parable: “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. 
7 Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, ‘Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?’ 
8 But he answered and said to him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. 
9 And if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after that you can cut it down.’ ”’*

This parable teaches us a lot about what it means to bear fruits of repentance. Jesus is the keeper of the vineyard and we’re the barren fig tree. When we think from this angle we can pick up characteristics of true repentance:

**1. Recognise how truly unworthy we are**  
We are the fig tree and for 3 years we were barren. The masters came to look for fruit but we bore nothing. Our fates were supposed to be death. To be truly repentant, we must really recognise how unworthy we are. The moment we start to think that we deserve forgiveness or have done something that is deserving of forgiveness, that is the moment we are not and cannot be truly repentant. 

Think about the example Jesus gave about the pharisee’s prayers and the prayers of the tax collector. The tax collector truly recognised his unworthiness and didn’t even dare to look up to heaven. On the other hand, the pharisee took out all the things he had done thinking that he was deserving of forgiveness. 

As fig trees, for 3 years we were barren and didn’t do anything worthy for the master. That’s the start of repentance. 

**2. Recognise how great God’s grace is to us**  
Jesus continued to show us grace though we’re unworthy like the keeper who pleaded to keep the fig tree for another and proceeded to dig around and add on fertiliser in hopes for the tree to bear fruit. 

We must realise the great love and grace Jesus has shown to us. As we sang in the opening hymn 353: “Beneath the Cross of Jesus”, the writer wrote, “Two wonders I confess, the wonders of His glorious love and my unworthiness”. Repentance requires us to realise how unworthy we really are and at the same time truly acknowledge the great grace and love the Lord Jesus Christ extends to us. 

**3. Bear the fruits of repentance**  
We cannot just stop at feeling unworthy and grateful; we also go on with this step. In the parable we read that the fig tree was given one more year and in this one year the fig tree MUST bear fruit. This fruit is the fruit that’s worthy of repentance. While grace is given to us freely, there is a period whereby this grace should have an impact in our lives to transform us. 

We read in Luke 3 the teachings of John the Baptist to the people who came to him. John the Baptist taught them that they’ve to bear the fruit worthy of repentance. He reminded the people that repentance is not only having the sense of unworthiness (they shouldn’t think they’re ascendant of Abraham and because of that lord themselves. Instead, they should recognise that they’re truly in need of repentance) but also taught the people what they should DO in their lives. 

For example, John the Baptist instructed the soldiers that they shouldn’t intimidate others. They should cease from doing what’s wrong. Bearing the fruit of repentance causes us to stop doing the sin we’re doing. John the Baptist also for example, told others to give tunics to those who’ve none. This person may have legally owned these 2 tunics but when John taught about the repentance, he meant to do good. 

Full repentance must be one that bears fruits of repentance and it requires a certain way we think and live our lives. When Jesus told those who’re living, “unless you repent, you too shall perish,” this is what repentance is supposed to be. 

True repentance begins with acknowledging our own unworthiness of forgiveness but at the same time also acknowledges God’s great grace to us though we’re unworthy. As a result, we lead a different kind of life, think different, stop doing what’s wrong and start doing what is right. 

Over the course of COVID-19, we probably would’ve heard many messages perhaps from bosses or people around to remind us that COVID-19 has changed the way things are forever. Some try to inspire by saying that there are lessons to learn from this situation. If these lessons are learnt, it’ll make the new normal a better normal. For example, some suggested that this situation can lead to a smaller gender pay gap because husbands now appreciate what their wives do at home. Hence, bosses recognise how difficult it is to raise a child while still having to work, leading to perhaps a better change in society. While these are good lessons to learn from COVID-19, as Christians, let us make sure to learn the main point Jesus wants us to learn: when tragedy strikes, it is not for those who survived to blame people but to introspect and repent; bear fruits worthy of repentance. 

## Example 2 
Jesus corrected a person because that person was also missing a point. This is found in Luke 10:38-42:  
*38 'Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. 
39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. 
40 But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.” 
41 And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 
42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”’*

V38 tells us that Martha invited Jesus into her house:  
*Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.*

When Jesus entered the house, there must’ve been many who entered the house as well because Jesus had disciples following Him. Hence, Martha must’ve felt that it was important to host guests well. When you walk on sandy paths, guests would need a lot of water to wash their feet. There’s also a lot of water needed for the guests to drink. Martha also had to ensure there was enough food so people wouldn’t be hungry while Jesus spoke. 

While she had to prepare many foods, she was probably happy because Jesus, this special rabbi, was in her house. As she continued serving, maybe listening to bits and pieces Jesus spoke to His disciples, she could have thought, “The disciples can teach me later even if I miss out now. It’s okay”. She then continued to be hard at work ensuring that the guests were serviced properly. 

She must’ve been worried about many things and that was what Jesus pointed out to her, “Do I have enough water? Is there enough food? Is there enough room?” All these worries took up her mind and eventually she wondered why she was the only one serving Jesus at that time. Why was she the only one serving Jesus to ensure all the guests are comfortable? Instead of joy, she started to be frustrated. When you’re frustrated, you look around to vent your anger at someone. 

When she noticed her own sister betraying her (her sister instead of acting like the host was sitting like a guest instead of helping out), she couldn’t stand it anymore and approached Jesus to lodge a complaint. Instead of responding in a way to support Martha, He took the opportunity to point Martha to the main point. During this incident we know that Martha missed the point while Mary knew what the main point was: instead of losing oneself in frustration and bitter service, it’s more important to sit by the feet of Jesus to listen. 

This important point was missed by Martha but those of us serving in church know that service time is for us to concentrate and listen to God’s words. In Ecclesiastes 5:1 *'Walk prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.’*

It’s more important for us to draw near to listen to God’s words rather than to offer sacrifices. We need to draw near to God to learn from His words, know His wills and only then our services will be meaningful. It is more important for us to listen to God’s words than just be bothered by bitter service. This is an important point for many of us who’re workers of God. 

The example of Martha, teaches us that if at any point of our service we start to feel a little distracted or upset at the way people are doing/not doing things, do we complain in our church work, “I’m the only one serving for Jesus. That person only sits there waiting to be served”? If so, let us be reminded of the main point: coming to church is to listen to God’s words. 

The speaker would like to point out another way a point is missed today. Some have misused or misinterpreted the example of Mary and Martha. Some of us may have missed the point also and this is the way the point is missed:  
The example of Martha shows that it’s better to be near the feet of Jesus and listen than to be distracted by works. Their conclusion is: by attending church services frequently, I’ve done my work and hence don’t need to offer sacrifice to fools. Attending church service is like listening to Jesus by His feet. The problem of this way of thinking is that we must realise that Mary who sat at the feet of Jesus didn’t always sit by the feet of Jesus. Mary also served Jesus at the most appropriate time. We turn to John 12.

In John 11, Mary experienced the grace of God because Jesus resurrected her brother, Lazarus. Not only did Mary experience the grace of God, this is what she was going to do in Luke 12:1-3:  
*1 'Then He said to the disciples, “It is impossible that no offenses should come, but woe to him through whom they do come! 
2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. 
3 Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. ‘*

What we read here is the particular service Mary would perform on Jesus. Because Mary appreciated the grace of God, she also sat at the foot of Jesus to learn the teachings of Jesus and God’s will. This is why she was one of the few who kind of recognised something in Jesus and hence took the opportunity to anoint Him. She realised that she had to take this chance to do something for Jesus before it’s too late. 

We know from Mary that you still must serve the Lord; you don’t just sit down to listen. You must ALSO SERVE! 

Service is a sweet smelling aroma because it’s done according to God’s will; because you know what’s required of you. This is the main point: we must come to the feet of Jesus and to learn of His will so we can serve Him at the most appropriate time. 

We’ve learnt previously that when we talk about understanding God’s grace, it’s meant to lean towards a change in our lives. We need to do work to repay this great grace God has given us; offer up a sweet smelling aroma to God according to the knowledge of God’s will. Let’s not miss the opportunity to serve Him. 

For tonight, the speaker shared about how Jesus corrected some who’ve missed the point. When tragedy strikes around us, what’s important for those alive is to repent. The components of repentance include the recognition that we’re unworthy; recognise how great the grace of God is despite the fact that we’re unworthy. That requires us to have a change in the way we think and the way we lead our lives. 

Today we’ve also come before Him to hear His words. We know it’s good and right to sit quietly by the feet of Jesus to listen but at the same time it’s also for us to be prepared to serve the Lord Jesus at the most appropriate time when the Lord has made it.
