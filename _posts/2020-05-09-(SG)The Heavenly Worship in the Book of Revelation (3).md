A main point discussed in previous sermons is for us to be able to see the throne which is in heaven. The throne in heaven is about the worship in heaven, and this is for us to reflect on whether our worship on earth is similar to the worship in heaven.

There are a few points we ought to learn and pursue based on the heavenly worship recorded in Rev 4.
1. See that the door of heaven is open  
2. Be lifted up to the Lord  
3. Focus and be able to see God who sits on the throne  

*(Points 1-3 were covered in parts 1 and 2 of this sermon series)*

## 4. See the thunderings and lightnings that proceed from the throne of God
Rev 4:5  
*And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.*

John saw/heard that there was lightnings, thunderings and voices from the throne. It represents the awe, majesty and righteous trial of God. 

Exo 20 records that God appeared before the people of Israel on Mount Sinai. Moses led the people to meet God while they were below the mountain. The mountain top was covered in smoke; there was lightning and thundering. The people of God at the foot of the mountain were so afraid they trembled in fear; they were afraid of the awe and majesty of God; they were afraid God was going to judge them of their iniquities and sins. Moses told them not to be afraid. God allowing them to see their awe and majesty wasn’t to intimidate or threaten them, but for them to have fear of God so they won’t sin against Him since He is a righteous God of judgement. 

Heb 12:27-29  
*Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire.*

All things which are made will be removed. This happens on the Day of Judgement where God will judge everyone according to their deeds. The kingdom that cannot be shaken is the Kingdom of Heaven. Those who repent will receive the salvation of God and enter into His kingdom. Whether one is able to enter the Kingdom of God depends on one’s piety in serving and worshipping God. Today as we worship before the throne of God, we must be able to see the thunderings and lightnings that proceed from the throne of God, which is to see the majesty and awe of God, so that we repent of our sins before Him and have a heart of piety and fear towards God, because our God is a consuming fear. 

John also saw that the throne is set in heaven. This means the throne was originally not there but set there thereafter. In the olden times, when a tribe carried out a judgement, a table and chair will be set at a specific place. The chief of the tribe and the leaders will be seated accordingly. The throne of God being set in heaven shows the judgement of God had already begun. But this doesn’t refer to the judgement of all men in the Last Days. It refers to the judgement in the house of God. 

1 Pet 4:17  
*For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?*

Judgement will begin from the household of God. The house of God is the church. The church is also referred to as the Heavenly Jerusalem. Therefore judgement of the throne in heaven starts from the church. The judgement in the church is carried out in accordance to the truth of the Lord. Violators of the truth will be admonished by the truth. If they continue to harden their hearts and refuse to repent, they will be cast out of the church. 

1 Cor 5:1-2, 12-13  
*It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s wife! And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you.*  
*For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.”*

Paul rebuked the Corinthian Church for not casting out this man who committed sin. The workers in the church of Corinth opined this man shouldn’t be fast out, while Paul, also a worker in the church, said he should be cast out. Even though they were both workers in church, why did they disagree?

Some people say: This is because the workers in the church of Corinth had love while the worker Paul had no love. 

But is this really the case? Was it an issue of love or was it because they didn’t obey and do according to the word of the Lord?

Matt 18:17-18  
*And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.
“Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.*

Actually, the words of the Lord Jesus are clear and simple. If a person doesn’t listen to the church, let him be like a heathen and tax collector. This saying or Jesus is not too complex. It’s whether we are willing to act in accordance to what Jesus said. Do we act in accordance to what Jesus said or in accordance to what we want? If we act in accordance to how we want to do it, the matter is ‘easily managed’. But acting in accordance to the word of the Lord may offend someone. A person whose heart is hardened and is unwilling to repent, who doesn’t listen to the church and commits things against the Lord, they should be cast out as per the words of the Lord. The issue is whether we are willing to act in accordance to the words of the Lord. Judgement begins with the house of the Lord. Jesus Christ is the head of the church. The church, in accordance to the words of the Lord Jesus, will mete out judgement and admonish the people. 

John also saw 7 lamps lit up before the throne. These 7 lamps refers to the 7 Spirits of God. This doesn’t mean God has 7 Spirits, rather it represents the complete almightiness and power of God. There’s nothing the Lord cannot accomplish, there’s nothing that will escape His knowing. Therefore the judgement of the Lord is definitely righteous. There will not be a single matter He won’t preside over; He definitely won’t judge a person wrongly. 

The 7 Spirits are like the 7 lamps. It shows it has complete brightness able to light up every corner. There will not be a single hidden corner that won’t be lit up by these lamps. No created being will be hidden from God. Therefore King David said, “Where can I go to escape You? Where can I run to escape Your presence?” Because everyone and every matter cannot take cover or hide from God. The only way is to come before God, acknowledge and repent of our sins, seeking forgiveness.

## 5. We must see the 4 living creatures surrounding the throne 
Rev 4:6-8  
*Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:
“Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty,
Who was and is and is to come!”*

These 4 living creatures are similar to the 4 living creatures recorded in Ezekiel. However, there’re some differences too. In Ezekiel, the 4 living creatures were Cherubim - a category of angels. They first appear in the garden of Eden, placed by God to guard it. But these 4 living creatures in Revelation aren’t Cherubim. They represent believers who will be saved. 

Rev 5:8-10  
*Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying:
“You are worthy to take the scroll,
And to open its seals;
For You were slain,
And have redeemed us to God by Your blood
Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
And have made us kings and priests to our God;
And we shall reign on the earth.”*

The 4 living creatures and 24 elders all sang a new song. “You have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe, tongue, people and nation.” The Chinese version of the Bible continues to say this is so He becomes their God and they become His people. The 4 living creatures seems different from the people purchased by His blood. But in the English version of the Bible, v10 says “made us kings and priests to our God”. According to the English version of the Bible, these 4 living creatures and 24 elders are also redeemed by His blood. Note how v9 says “redeemed US”, implying that the 24 elders and 4 living creatures refer to believers purchased by His blood. If the 4 living creatures refers to believers, it could be that God wants us to be like the 4 living creatures in terms of their spirit. 

**1. Lion**  
The first living creature is like a lion (it’s not a lion, but LIKE a lion). Believers cannot be lions but we can be LIKE a lion, that is to have the same spirit of a lion. This means bravery and fearlessness, especially in the face of battle. Lions are brave and fearless in the face of challenges. Our life of faith is like a battle. Believers should be like a lion, meeting with different challenges we have in our faith. 

A saying: a lion beats a rabbit with all its strength.  
This means a matter is not despised even if it’s small. Even if it’s a small matter, he pays attention to it and uses all its strength for it. In the face of big and small , we must pat attention to it and muster our greatest strength against it. Don’t despise it because we deem it a ‘small temptation’. 

When the Israelites went against the city of Ai, they thought they would be able to gain an easy victory because it was a small city. But they were beaten and 36 died as a consequence. 

In our fight of faith, we should not despise any temptations, big or small. Hymn 213 reminds us that a grain of sand is very small, but it makes a beauteous hilly land. Do not look down on small, little offences, because it’ll accumulate and entangle us in the web of sin. When faced with challenges of faith and temptations, we have to be like the lion that beats the rabbit with all its strength. 

**2. Calf**  
The second living creature is like a calf, which is a small ox. A big ox is used to plow the fields or pull the cart. A small ox/calf is used for sacrifice to God or reception of guests. For example when Abraham received the 3 guests, he offered up the most tender calf. So the spirit of the calf is the offering and dedication of love. But this offering and dedication of love can be perfect or imperfect. Some are willing to offer their calf to God and not to men. Some are willing to offer their calf to men but not to God. So their offering and dedication of love is imperfect. Some love God but not man; some love man and not God. But Abraham was willing to offer his calf to both God and man. His perfect offering and dedication of love is something we ought to learn from. 

**3. Man**  
The third living creature is like a man. The face of believers is a man already, why should our face be LIKE a man? Consider these sayings: 不要脸 (don’t want face), 丢脸 (lose face/disgraceful), 没有脸见人 (no face to face people). There’re many people whose face is really not like a man. This is why God wants believers face to be like a man. 

Eph 4:20-24  
*But you have not so learned Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.*

Paul talks about the old and new man. Man was originally created in the image of God, so man’s face was supposed to be glorious. But after man sinned against God, he loses this glory. His face becomes full of sin. The man who is a sinner is the old man, while the new man refers to those who believe in Jesus and have been cleansed by His blood. He regains the image of glory because his sins have been washed away. Therefore Paul encouraged them not to sin against God. He portrays the image of man in accordance to the likeness of God - true righteousness and holiness of the truth. 

**4. Eagle**  
The fourth living creature is like an eagle. The wings of an eagle are strong and full of energy. Because of that, eagles can soar high in the sky. 

Isa 40:31  
*But those who wait on the Lord
Shall renew their strength;
They shall mount up with wings like eagles,
They shall run and not be weary,
They shall walk and not faint.*  
Eagles are willing to soar alone high up in the sky. They are unwilling to spend their time lusting after the things of earth. 

Phil 3:17-20  
*Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern. For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame—who set their mind on earthly things. For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ*

At the beginning of the book of Philippians, when Paul talked about the believers, he was full of joy in his heart. But at the end when he talks about certain groups of believers, he was weeping with tears. These group of believers had their belly as their god. They only concerned themselves with eating?. They set their minds on earthly things. They treated giving in to the lust of their flesh as a form of glory. If they continued to be in that state and refused to repent, their end is destruction. Paul encourages us as believers to set our minds on things above, not on things on earth, because our citizenship is in heaven and not on earth. We have to pray that God helps us to be able to be like the eagle; to spread our wings and soar in the sky, far away from all the evil corruption in the world. Do you truly believe your citizenship is in heaven? Do you think more about the things on earth or the things in heaven?

COVID-19 has affected us in many ways. People worry about dying because of it. But actually, we shouldn’t be worried about dying due to the virus, because death will befall everyone of us. What we should be really worried about is whether we can get to heaven after we die. If we haven’t received the Holy Spirit which is the evidence of our inheritance in heaven, we should be anxious. Let us pray for God to give us His mercy and precious Holy Spirit.
