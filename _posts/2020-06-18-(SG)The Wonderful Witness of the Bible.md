Summary:  
1. The Bible witnesses to itself
2. The Bible witnesses to Jesus as the Christ
3. The Bible witnesses that Christ is the foundation of the church
 
Hymn 25 (God's Law is Perfect and Gives Life) is taken from Psalm 19. Psalm 19 tells us of the laws, the testimonies, the commandments, the judgements of God; in short, the Bible. The Chinese version of the hymn says, “It makes wise the simple.” The Holy Bible is not a book only for the highly educated. In fact, the Word of God is not for those who think that they are wise. The Bible says that if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask from God and He will give them wisdom. The Lord has the Bible to those who are not that wise but want to seek wisdom. We must love the Bible because it is a source of wisdom that comes from God.

Loving the truth and loving the Bible are closely related but are not the same things. Before a person becomes a Christian, he could be diligently seeking the truth because God has put this heart of seeking the truth in him. In his desire for the truth, he seeks out holy books and religious texts to read. Then, he discovers that the Bible stands out from among the rest. (Just as Pr Chin Aun Quek mentioned yesterday that the Holy Bible should be placed at the right and the rest at the left with a space between them.) When you read the Bible, you’ll discover that it is the ONLY book that qualifies as the source for spiritual truth. Then, the seeker of truth will realise that loving the Truth means loving the Bible. Truth is of course greater than the Bible, because truth is so vast; there’s so much truth in the mind of God, it’s practically infinite. You cannot understand all the Truth there is in the mind of God but the Bible is what God has revealed in the mind to us; the Bible is revealed truth. We turn to Deuteronomy 29:29;     

*The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.*

Here, the Bible tells us that there are things that are secret and there are things that are revealed. The things that are secret are not for us to know because they belong to God. Hence, there are things out there that are secret, but there is also truth recorded in the Bible and that is the truth revealed to us. That belongs to us because God gave it to us. It also belongs to our children and humanity forever because He gave the Bible to humanity. If we can have a glimpse of God’s infinite truth, won’t we treasure them?  

In the Old Testament, God started to reveal the Truth to His people. There were a lot of secret truths and there were more and more truth revealed; that was how the Holy Bible got compiled. Even right up to the New Testament time when Jesus Christ came to reveal what ultimately God wants us to know, there were still secrets that belonged to the Lord. In Revelation 10:4;  
*Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.”*
 
The book of Revelation is the last book in the Bible. Jesus appeared to John and revealed many things. Here, there are the 7 thunders that uttered mystery and John knew what those things were about. However, God told him to not write it because they were supposed to be sealed. The Truth is greater than the Bible but the Bible itself is to be treasured because Truth cannot be known unless God gives it to us. The Holy Bible is so precious because it is the truth of God that is revealed.

God tells us that He would not do anything in this human world unless He first reveals it to His prophets. If you want to know God’s will, if you want to know what God is going to do, you have to read the Holy Bible. Read Amos 3:7;  

*Surely the Lord God does nothing,
Unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.*

That was what happened in the Old Testament so people would look out for the work of God to do His will and be obedient people. In the New Testament, people came. There was once when He spoke to a Samaritan woman and the woman reckoned that He was a prophet. She then went on to say, “When the anointed one comes, He will teach us all things.” She was right because Jesus did not correct her. In fact, Jesus acknowledged it and said that the one speaking to her was Christ.

What we know for sure is that whatever we need to know has already been revealed when the Bible was completed. First, God speaks to the prophets. Secondly, God spoke through Christ. 

There was a time when Jesus told HIs disciples, “I have many things to tell you but I cannot bear it for now. I will now keep it in My pocket first. It is not meant to be sealed but I will keep it for now. When I go back to the Father, I will send the Holy Spirit to you. The Holy Spirit will not reveal any new things but He will take whatever is in my pocket and give it to you.” 

All that we need to know has now been given to us in this precious book. The Holy Spirit came, inspired the apostles, and they wrote whatever needed to give us in this book. We should love the Bible because it represents all truth. When Christ comes, He will give us all things. 

If we love the Bible, we will read it everyday; we will spend our entire lives studying it. The Bible is like a key to a big house full of treasures. There are many rooms full of treasures with many treasure boxes. What do we do with this key? Do we just keep it in our pockets? If we live our Bibles on our shelves, it is leaving this key in the pocket and never opening to the box of treasures. 

We will look at 3 points this afternoon. What does the Bible witness to?

**1. What the Bible says about itself**  
**2. The wonderful witness to Christ**  
**3. The wonderful foundation of the church; Christ is the foundation of the church**  

## 1. What does the Bible say about itself?   
Read Hebrews 1:1-2;   

*God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds;*


Here we see how the 66 books of the Bible were compiled and here it talked about 2 different inspirations: 

When God spoke indirectly through the prophets  
Spoke to us indirectly  
When God speaks through Christ (through His Son)   
Spoke to us directly   

In the Last Days, He speaks directly to us because He says here that He speaks by His son. Jesus Christ is the Son of God and we know that He is God Himself incarnate. Hence, the description here of this Son is divine. He is the creator of the world. So Jesus Christ is God directly speaking to humanity and that is the New Testament period. 

In the Old Testament, God spoke through the prophets, the New Testament is Jesus speaking to us. 

**Unity of the Bible**  
The Old Testament and New Testament  is a unified book because it is the same God/author who speaks through different people. We also see the continuity because He spoke indirectly through the prophets first. 

In the Old Testament, there are many prefigurations, shadows and stories. In the New Testament, the fulfillment takes place and the New Testament explains these stories to make it meaningful. All the stories we hear of people with a distant past has to do with us. When we read the New Testament, we will realise that the words of Jesus and of the apostles had many quotations of the Old Testament. The New Testament  Is a commentary of the Old Testament, there is continuity. The New Testament is so clear for us. 

We also see the completeness of the Holy Bible. Here says that the time when Jesus comes is the Last Days. ‘Last Days’ means the period of time leading to the end of the world. Hence, God came to speak to us directly in the New Testament. Then, the end of the age will arrive; that is after Jesus had come, giving words to apostles and sending the Holy Spirit to apostles. That is when the Word is complete. There is no other truth after the Bible because the rest is not true.  


People may claim that there are other truths but according to Hebrews 1:1-2, this claim is not true. There is no more revelation after the New Testament because as mentioned earlier, Christ has come and He has taught us all things and the Holy Spirit leads us into all truth. Everything we need to know is in the Bible. All that we need to go through this difficult journey called life is found in this Holy Bible; it really is our complete guide and it’s suitable for different entry levels. 

We sang hymn 25 just now and referred to Psalm 19, “This book makes wise the simple,” there is no high barrier to enter. Even children can read the Bible. Have you heard of this series called the “Complete Idiot Guide to...”? The Bible is simple enough for it to qualify as “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Life.” You can also enter to study the Bible at intermediate and advanced level. The point is: you can read the Bible from a very simple level. We turn to Romans 15:4; 

*For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.*


Paul wrote to the Roman church during the time when the New Testament was still not finished. Hence, he says that whatever written in the Old Testament is written for our sakes. He quoted from the Psalm. The Old Testament scripture gives us (NT believers) comfort and hope.

Some may think that the Old Testament is irrelevant to us but it has a lot of relevance to us because it is written for our learning. There is a lot of comfort and hope in the Old Testament scriptures! 

Read Romans 16:25-26; 

 *Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret since the world began but now made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for obedience to the faith—*


Here it tells us that the prophetic scripture (Old Testament) is meant to be broadcasted to the whole world but it takes a different form, that is the gospel. In other words, the Old Testament scriptures are now the very content of the gospel that we preach. The things that were not known beforehand are now revealed to us. The things written in mysterious ways in the Old Testament in the form of stories and rituals are now explained very clearly to us. It is repackaged into the gospel to be broadcast to the whole world. The comfort and the hope is the gospel; the good news. Turn to 1 Peter 1:10-12;

*10 Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,   
11 searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.   
12 To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which angels desire to look into.*


In the New Testament, Peter testified for the Old Testament. He says that the Old Testament prophets knew that when they spoke those prophecies, those prophecies were ultimately not for their era. Ultimately, it’s not about them but US, the New Testament. The Holy Spirit spoke to the Old Testament prophets but Peter here uses the term, “The Spirit of Christ” because the prophetic writings are ultimately about Christ and His work of salvation. Like what we’ve said earlier, the gospel is like a repackaged prophetic book. 

Then, Peter wrote his second epistle and told us something very interesting. In 2 Peter 1:16-21;

*16 For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.   
17 For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”   
18 And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.  
19 And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;  
20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation,   
21 for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.* 
  


V16 says, “When I tell you about Jesus Christ, we are not inventors of myth. When we say that Jesus is the prophesied Messiah, we say that Jesus is the Son of God, Jesus is the saviour of the whole world, Jesus wants to save not just the Jews but everyone. These aren’t fabrications because we have the Old Testament basis.” 

V21;   
*for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.* 

Because this prophecy came from God and is not the words of men, we cannot interpret prophecies on a whim.

V20;   
*knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation*

“No private interpretations”  
What Peter was trying to say is this: everything that we tell you about Jesus - right now we can paraphrase and say that everything we read in the New Testament - are not human fabrications but how the Holy Spirit led the apostles of Jesus Christ to understand the Old Testament. The apostles then took the Old Testament prophecies and applied it to Jesus to say that He is Christ,  the Son of God. God Himself bears testimony and said, “This is My beloved Son.” Some (Jewish leaders) during those times doubted, but what did Gameliel (teacher of Paul) say? He said, “If it is not from God, it’ll die off. What if all these New Testament are from God? Then you’ll be going against God! Keep quiet and be wise!” 

Before Jesus, there are many messianic movements to say this or this is Christ. After Jesus, there were also others. Jesus said they were false Christ and prophets and later on they’ve all died off. The only messianic movement present is the Christian faith! It has now become international and worldwide! The New Testament is translated into more languages than the Old Testament. Following Gameliel’s principle, God’s Holy Spirit proved that Christianity is THE truth! Christianity is the truth and the New Testament is truly the Word of God! The New Testament is the ONLY authentic interpretation of the Old Testament! Moreover, Jesus Himself has proven that He is the Christ because of His resurrection. The Old Testament and New Testament all point to Jesus Christ. The only way to explain the Old Testament is to say that Jesus is THE Christ. That brings us to the 2nd point.

## 2. Both the Old Testament and New Testament are the wonderful witness to Jesus as Christ. 
John 1:45-46;  

*Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”
Philip said to him, “Come and see.”*


Phillip was so excited when he saw Jesus because he knew what the Old Testament law and prophets said about Christ and he thought that Jesus was the one. Excitedly, he told his friend, Nathanael, to come see Joseph's son, Jesus. Nathanael then said, “What good thing can come out of Nazareth?”

Why the different reactions of Phillip and Nathanael? What has been written in the law of prophets about Christ? Let’s look a few more chapters ahead in John 5:39;  
*You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.*


If it is so clear, why are there people who refuse to go to Jesus? Because v40 says; 

*But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.*

Acts 10:43;  

*To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.”*


Here it says, “To Him, all the prophets gave witness.”   
It seems to be very clear as well as exhaustive. There were many many witnesses — ALL the prophets point to Jesus! Here also says Jesus can bring about the remission of sins. 

Today, it’s very clear. We cannot blame Nathanael at that time and Jesus didn’t blame him as well. Jesus even called him a true Israelite because he was an honest seeker seeking an honest question. Today, Jesus has proven himself to have the power to forgive sin because He has come back to life! Read Acts 10:40-42;

*40 Him God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly,  
41 not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.    
42 And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead.*  


Here, God raised Jesus up from the dead and we’re His witnesses. In the Old Testament, we have the prophets pointing to Jesus and in the New Testament, many of the writers were eye-witnesses. The entire Bible, Old Testament and New Testament, work together to prove that Jesus is the Christ. 

We may still ask, “What did the prophets and the Law say about Jesus that is so clear?”   
Just as Pr CAQ mentioned, there are hundreds and hundreds of prophecies and we’ve no time to talk about all of them. At this moment, we have our Closer Day by Day schedule and we’re at the first book of the New Testament. By the time the gospel of Matthew was written, the resurrection of Jesus had already taken place and it was irrefutable. By the time the gospel of Matthew was written, he could just say, “Jesus was born of a virgin.” In Matthew 1:23 quoted from Isaiah;   

*Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”*



This could be substantiated because Jesus came back to life, because He had no sin. We often explain that virgin birth means Jesus had no sin. Therefore, death couldn’t hold him back. Jesus overcoming death proves many things; that is EVERYTHING prophesied in the Old Testament. Because all the prophets point to Christ and Jesus fulfilled everything. Therefore, He is the Christ. This is 1 reason why Matthew keeps using the world “fulfilled”; because He fulfilled everything. 

Look at 2 examples in Matthew 2. 
**1. Matthew 2:15;**  
*and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”*
“Out of Egypt I call My son”  
When God called Israel out of Egypt, He told Moses to tell pharoah, “Israel is My Son, My Firstborn.” At that time, He already had Jesus in mind because Jesus Christ is going to be the ultimate saviour to lead us out of the real Egypt (sinful bondage). We’re all enslaved by sin. Even the book of Revelation says that Jesus was crucified in  spiritual Egypt. Jesus is the real saviour to save us from sin. 

**2. Matthew 2:17-18;**  

*Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
“A voice was heard in Ramah,
Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children,
Refusing to be comforted,
Because they are no more.”*

“It was fulfilled”   
What was fulfilled? We know the infamous incident where Herod wanted to seek Jesus and hence killed all the baby boys aged 2 years and below. There was a voice crying in Ramah; Rachel weeping for her children. If we don’t look back to the Old Testament, we won’t understand what this means. Always remember that the Old Testament and New Testament corroborate and the New Testament explains the Old Testament. Look at the book of Jeremiah where this is found, Jeremiah mentioned this to Judah and said, “Don’t cry! Cry for what? Rachel crying for her children, cry for what! Now when Herod kills the baby boy, God is going to comfort you!”

In the book of Jeremiah, he says, “You people going back to Babylonian captivity is the second captivity.”   

Rachel was crying for her children but Jeremiah ends off and says that there was no need to cry; stop weeping for there’s hope! Jeremiah said, “Your children will come back! Israel and Judah will come back!: When Matthew quoted, “Out of Egypt I will call out my sons,” Matthew was saying, “There’s hope! Jesus is your hope. Jesus is going to put an end to the Babylonian exile!” This is a wonderful witness the Bible bears to the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The main thing the Bible testifies is Jesus’ death on the cross. Paul says that it’s the central theme of the Bible. What did the Bible say? The Bible confirmed that this is recorded in the Bible. 

Compare Psalm 40 and Hebrews 10.   
We will see that Jesus Christ said that God doesn’t want all these sacrifices but they’ve been prepared. Isn’t this recorded in the book? It is! it is in the Bible, and it talked about the death of Jesus. Through His death, He overame Satan’s slavery and came back from death. 

Paul also told Timothy, “From a child, you know that the holy scripture is able to make you wise unto salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.” The Old Testament and New Testament testify Jesus Christ. 

## 3. The wonderful foundation of the church; Christ is the foundation of the church
The Holy Bible testifies that Jesus Christ is the one that will build the ultimate temple which is the church. From the Holy Bible, we can even see ourselves (TJC). Read Ephesians 2:19–22;
*Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.*
Here it says that we, the people of God, are founded on a foundation made up of the prophets and apostles, Jesus being our chief cornerstone. “We” refers to the house of God. The verses tell us to be built up to be a holy temple. When the bible mentions apostles and prophets, it refers to their teachings. This is the recorded truth in the Bible. The revealed truth of God is the foundation of the church. Ephesians 3:5-6;  

which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,



Here, the body of Christ, church, will comprise not just Jews but also the Gentiles. This is a mystery once hidden now revealed to the apostles and prophets. What’s been revealed to them becomes the foundation of the church. The foundation is the New Testament understanding of the Old Testament. We are built up as a temple. The Old Testament uses the temple image to explain the church. Read Ephesians 3:21;  

“to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.”


In the church is the glory of God. In the Old Testament, after the temple (or even the tabernacle in the wilderness) was dedicated, the glory of God filled it. Such that Moses, the priests, nobody, could enter. But what happened to this glory? It left the temple, as seen by Ezekiel. It was destroyed. But now Ephesians 3 says that there’ll be glory in the church and till he forever, it’ll never depart! Read Haggai 2:4-9;

4 Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says the Lord; ‘and be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land,’ says the Lord, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ says the Lord of hosts. 
5 ‘According to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit remains among you; do not fear!’
6 “For thus says the Lord of hosts: Once more (it is a little while) I will shake heaven and earth, the sea and dry land; 
7 and I will shake all nations, and they shall come to the Desire of All Nations, and I will fill this temple with glory,’ says the Lord of hosts. 
8 ‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,’ says the Lord of hosts. 
9 The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than the former,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘And in this place I will give peace,’ says the Lord of hosts.”


The prophecy of God came upon Haggai. As Zerubbabel and Joshua led the people to rebuild the destroyed temple, the prophecy of God came upon Haggai, Peter said Haggai prophesied of the distant future. There will come a time God comes to shake all nations. This temple will be so much more glorious than its former glory. This is the church that’ll be even more glorious than the former temple. If the latter temple represents the church which is the spiritual temple which was led by Christ, then Zerubbabel and Joshua who led the rebuilding of the former temple are foreshadows of Christ.   
Read Haggai 2:22-23;

22 I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms;
I will destroy the strength of the Gentile kingdoms.
I will overthrow the chariots
And those who ride in them;
The horses and their riders shall come down,
Every one by the sword of his brother.
23 ‘In that day,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel My servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says the Lord, and will make you like a signet ring; for I have chosen you,’ says the Lord of hosts.”


Zerubbabel will be made like a signet ring which represents kingship. Jesus who is king is hence foreshadowed by Zerubbabel. 

How does Joshua foreshadow Christ? 
Read Zechariah 6:11-13;  

11 Take the silver and gold, make an elaborate crown, and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 
12 Then speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying:

“Behold, the Man whose name is the BRANCH!
From His place He shall branch out,
And He shall build the temple of the Lord;
13 Yes, He shall build the temple of the Lord.
He shall bear the glory,
And shall sit and rule on His throne;
So He shall be a priest on His throne,
And the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” ’


Joshua was not a son of David but was a High Priest. But God says to crown him and he will rule on his throne. This shows how Jesus is both High Priest and King. Jesus’ body is the temple, full of the glory of God and will never depart! Do we see TJC in the Bible then? Absolutely! At the time when Joshua and Zerubabbel led the ppl to rebuild the temple, the foundation had already laid but the work was halted for about 15-16 years. That was why Haggai and Zechariah had to come up with all these prophecies. Then the work resumed.   
During the apostolic time, Jesus, who was the fulfilment of both Joshua and Zerubabbel, came. Jesus built this temple. He said that in 3 days it’ll be destroyed and He’d raise it up. He did so by resurrecting. 

The Bible was miraculously preserved. If the foundation is destroyed then there’s no hope.

Read Zechariah 4:6-9;

6 So he answered and said to me:
“This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel:
Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’
Says the Lord of hosts.
7 ‘Who are you, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain!
And he shall bring forth the capstone
With shouts of “Grace, grace to it!” ’ ”
8 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
9 “The hands of Zerubbabel
Have laid the foundation of this temple;
His hands shall also finish it.
Then you will know
That the Lord of hosts has sent Me to you.


Jesus laid the foundation during the apostolic time. Today, we’re the work of Jesus and we shall complete it. We must have the faith to believe that! Because our faith and doctrine is exactly the same as the apostolic time. Read 1 Thessalonians 2:13;  

For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.


When Paul preached to the Thessalonians, their hearts were so ready to receive the preaching because they allowed God to work in their hearts.   
In Acts 13:2-3;  

As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away.


When they went to Thessalonians to preach in the synagogue, they used the Old Testament scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Christ. The Thessalonians didn’t believe the apostles merely without any basis. They realised that the apostles interpreted the Old Testament and applied it to Jesus in a very believable way. It allowed the Holy Spirit to make them see.

After they were at Thessalonica, the apostles went to Berea. The people in Berea were more fair minded than the Thessalonians. They were just as ready to receive teachings but were more diligent. After believing, they continued to search the scriptures. This was not for the purpose of doubting but to understand the Scripture better. May our love for the Word of God be like the Bereans. Amen.
