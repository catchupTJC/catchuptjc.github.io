Summary:  
1. Am I a temple meet for God's dwelling?
2. Let us build up a place to stir up love and good works! 


How time has passed so quickly. Before we know it, it is already July 2020. We are in phase 2 of reopening. Elections are coming. Very quickly 7 months of dealing with COVID-19 has passed by. The saying goes, time and tide waits for no man. These special times have disrupted many of our lives and work. However, look back and you will also see the grace of God in our lives. Consider how He has provided for each of us. Also how He has preserved us and ignited a flame within all of us. Many of us have started attending more services because of the pandemic. Many of us have begun to pray more and to read the bible more because of the plague. That is all good. And we thank God for His providence.  
Time indeed passes very quickly. Before we know it, it is already July 2020. Consider, what have you done for the Lord? What happened to all the resolutions you made for your faith? Before the turn of the year, during lunch in church, a few older brothers asked some of the younger brothers, what would you do for the Lord? What is your ambition, so to speak, for God? Before age and decay catch up with you. Before you know it you are already 40 and older. Before you know it, you are wearing glasses and unable to read.   


Let us rise up and build was the call to action from Nehemiah to the people living in Israel after returning from the captivity. Although the temple had been rebuilt, the walls of Jerusalem were not. 
Neh 2:11-20  
*So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire. Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass. So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.
Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.” And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me.
So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to this good work.
But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”
So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”*


In this passage we see that Nehemiah had returned to Jerusalem. He had surveyed the extent of the work to be done. Meeting up with the people, he told them “Let us rise up and build.”  

This is where today’s sharing gets its title from. Nehemiah was one who was concerned for the state of his people and for the state of the city of Jerusalem. His heart was motivated to come to Jerusalem. To help rebuild the city because of the report he received from his brother in Neh 1. He saw a need, and he took the step to fulfil it. He galvanised the people, and by increase of God, the work was completed in 52 days. 

Just as in Nehemiah’s time, they needed to build the temple and the walls, today we have also been engaged by God in a project to build up the temple of God. For the sake of today’s discussion, we will be talking about the temple and the walls together as a matter of church building. 


The speaker will discuss mainly 2 points today. Let us rise up and build, firstly, a temple meet for God’s dwelling. Secondly, let us rise up and build a place to stir up love and good works. 

Firstly, the people of the land were ready to build the walls when Nehemiah presented them a cause for them. The first point would be more for us to reflect on ourselves. Let us consider that we are all the temple of God.    
1Cor 6:19-20  
*Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.*


We are all where God chooses to put His spirit. That is where God meets with His people. Individually, He meets you in you. There is a hymn which goes, O to be like thee, while I am pleading, Pour out thy Spirit, fill with thy love. Make me a temple meet for thy dwelling.   
The people during Nehemiah’s time had the heart to help rebuild the city walls. Sure they did not start until Nehemiah returned and encouraged them. The people during Zerubabbel’s time had the heart to return to build the temple. We are now people living in our times. The time where God has allocated to us. We are going to help build the church of God. The question now is, are we willing to come back, are we willing to work for God. When the speaker mentioned the first point being, “building a temple meet for God’s dwelling”,the speaker did not mean building up the church worthy of God. Rather, let us consider if each and everyone of us are working to be temples meet for God’s dwelling.   

A place where God abides is a place which is holy (1 Pet 1:16), which executes the commands of God and which pursues the will of God (1 Jn 4:7-13). In 1 Samuel, the glory of God had left Israel because the priesthood corrupted themselves. They no longer interceded for the people but paved the way for their own destruction. God chose no longer to abide with them. When Israel and Judah forsook the ways of God, God left them to the enemies. Judah was left a remnant because they defiled the land with much evil. Yes, God left them to their enemies. 

Brothers and sisters, we are also individually temples of the living God, and of His Holy Spirit. Let us rise up and build up ourselves in the most holy faith. 
Jude 20-21  
*But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.*

Let us examine ourselves, as Nehemiah examined the walls. Consider our state. Maybe we have faults which we know about. Let us work on them. 

Neh 4:10  
*Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.”*

We see that the work was hindered because of the rubbish of the land. These were getting in their way.   
Today, look around at our state. Remove the trash - the faults of ours. Sins that prevent us from contributing more to the church, and to God. It could be our temperament. With a nasty temperament, how do we hope to work together with our brothers and sisters? It could be our lack of faith or trust in God’s promise. How do we expect to pray and work in wait with our brothers and sisters? It could be our habits or pride. When we think of ourselves more highly than we ought. When we worry too much about what others think of our work. When we consider our image before man more than how we are before God. It could be our desires which hinder us from focusing on God. 

The verse in Corinthians, reads very heavily. If we destroy God’s temple, God will destroy us. Paul warns us against sexual immorality. But the idea that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit does not stop there. And indeed, we are not perfect as we are now. But as long as God is with us, we need to work towards being holy and acceptable to God. If you are angry, pause and pray to God to help you overcome. If you are feeling lazy or weak, pray for strength from God. If you are tempted, flee to God. If you know of a fellowship within your reach, do not hesitate to join. Exercise God’s word in our lives. Remove that rubbish. Build up yourselves with the cedar wood. With gold, silver, precious stones. With stones. Build up yourselves to be glorious Temples of God. So that everyone will see that God lives in you. And through you, all will come to the knowledge of God. Rise up and build. Rise up to the challenge to give more time to God. Rise up to remove the filth that you long could not stand. Rise up so that you will see God’s power working in you to transform you. Rise up so that we will all be Temples meet for the dwelling of our Lord. Let your temple be furnished with the talents that God supplies. Let your temples be vessels of honour. Rise up and build.

“Let us rise up and build”, said the people when Nehemiah told the people of the state of the land. They were ready to build the wall. 
Neh 3:6-12  
*Moreover Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors, with its bolts and bars. And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor of the region beyond the River. Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Also next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they fortified Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, leader of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs. Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs in front of his house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabniah made repairs.
Malchijah the son of Harim and Hashub the son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section, as well as the Tower of the Ovens. And next to him was Shallum the son of Hallohesh, leader of half the district of Jerusalem; he and his daughters made repairs.*

Under the direction of Nehemiah, in Neh 3:6-12, the people arose to build the wall. Each one worked a portion of the wall. The work was tough, could they fix it? Working together they got the job done. 

Today we are abundantly clear that the church is not perfect. Some point to the attitude of the people. That there is a lack of love in the church. Some point to the culture, in that Singapore’s church culture is so cold and reserved. Some point to the leaders, that they should have done some things differently. Whatever it is, we are very aware of the shortcomings of the church. 

Let us not forget that we are all working toward the same goal. We are all seeking to build the church. To build the walls. Let us learn from the people of the land. Maybe they didn’t like Nehemiah’s style of working, but you see that each one focused on a portion within their reach. Each focused on the portion assigned to them to work there. We are often very focused on the grand scheme of things and neglect that the basics we can do are not done. When we say that the church lacks love. Do you contribute to it? When you see a stranger in the church, do you let the stranger remain a stranger to you? When you see the problems in the church, do you own them as your own as well? And do you try to effect a positive trend in your own capacity? To care for another? Or do we behave like the Tobiah and Sanballat who scoff at the work of God? At the work that everyone is doing. Let us not become enemies of God.

Before the discussion becomes too broad, let us focus on one area. Building the youth fellowship. When we participate in the youth fellowship, what do we imagine it to do? What do we imagine the youth group should accomplish? 
Heb 10:24-25  
*And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.*

The purpose of our gathering is very simple. Stir up love and good works. So that all will hold fast to God. In this youth fellowship and service, all of us have a part to play. To look out for each other. To stir up faith and good works. To constantly remind each other to return to God. 
What is your vision for the youth group? What do you think it should be? Or we do not think about it? Do you feel included? Excluded? Secluded?  
 
When we think about it, you will realise that the youth group does not capture everyone within the same demographic of youths. For example, RE students, consider how many of your peers are not here today. The older youths, the same. Beyond a certain age, we do not capture many of them. Some disengage themselves. By the grace of God, they find other church fellowships to join. But amongst the demographic we are supposed to capture, how many do not appear? It is easy to point fingers at those that do not join and blame them. They are not faithful enough. But how can that be? Our gathering is supposed to help stir up faith and good works. It is precisely because they are disengaged that they are not stirred up in love and to do good works. Youth service attendance and service attendance is to engage people and stir up their faith and good works not to condemn another for their lack of faith because of their non-attendance. 

We need to stir up love and good works. If you are encouraged, when you attend youth service, do you stop there and not share with your brothers and sisters? If you know of a fellowship, you have the time, you know it is good to join, do you do it? What is your vision for the youth group? That each may find strength, and healing here. That each may find refuge and confidence in God and in one another. That each may encourage each other to continue this race. To stir up love and good works. As youths, the youth service is our priority outside the Sabbath. This is where we are needed, and where we need to attract youths to Christ. 

We are a gathering of like-minded children of Christ. So let us rise up and build. Rise up and build that we may reach out to those who have not joined us. Rise up and build that all who come may reach God in our fellowships. Rise up and build so that we have a group we can rely on. Rise up and build so that we are able to care for one another. Each of us can play our small part. To build that portion of wall or task in front of us. Each of us working together, praying together, trusting together can we get the job done. Because God will be with us. 

2 Chron 16:9  
*For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.”*

To the loyal of heart, God will show Himself strong. If we take the step to reach out to your brothers and sisters, God will work. Let us rise up and build so that the benefits and encouragement you have received may reach out to those who need it. So that the body of Christ is closed knitted. Nourished by each joint.

Eph 4:16  
*from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.*

Let us rise up and build so that God will testify that we are a body that stirs up love and good works.

In the time of Nehemiah, the people rose up to build. They saw the need. They followed Nehemiah’s lead. God showed Himself strong. He worked with them. The walls were built. Nearly 2 decades earlier, the temple was also rebuilt. Today, we remember the work which they have done, faith which they displayed.   
Today, we also are in a similar position. We know the problems of the church, we know that there are gaps for us to fill. We know that there is work to be done. We know that perhaps down the road, if we do not do anything, God will send someone to deliver. But our own group, our own generation, that may not be delivered. Rise up and build therefore not to be remembered by the generations after us, but for the sake of each one of us. That we will not be a generation remembered by God, as a generation that did not do anything for Him.


There was another call to action recorded in the bible. Not to rise up and build, but to rise up and conquer. 

Num 13:30  
*Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.”*

Like in the times of Nehemiah and in the times of Caleb, there was a mission for the people of God. The task may be difficult. And there may be tons of excuses not to do them or to support the actions of the church. For example, waking up on Sunday to attend youth service. Or not attending choir during the time of COVID-19. Or not attending bible studies on Saturdays because we have something else to do. Problems may present themselves. Difficulties may arise. Like enemies and foes which appear harder to defeat than first thought. But the difference between success and failure is simple. A man of God trusts the promises of God and does them. Because He trusts that God is the one who gives the increase. 

Caleb and Nehemiah both believed and acted in their belief. God’s church will surely be victorious. Just like how Canaan was conquered by the generation after. Just like how the walls were rebuilt by the generation after. If we do not do anything, God will forget our generation, and remember only the generation after. How were the people in Nehemiah and Caleb different? One thought that there was something else they could be doing instead of building the nation. The other said, “Let us arise and build”.
