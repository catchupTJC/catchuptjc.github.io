Summary:  
This sermon covers 3 main points:  
(1) Why do we rejoice in the midst of tribulations?  
(2) How can we have joy in suffering?  
(3) What should we be doing to rejoice in tribulation?

During this pandemic, we have gone through the Circuit Breaker and hence have been home for a long time. We thank God that though we are impeded from freedom, we are not suffering. Among the first century believers who believed in Christ and practiced their faith, they were not only opposed but also persecuted. Yet, the Bible exhorts believers to rejoice always in the midst of tribulations. Turn to Philippians 4:4; 

*'Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!'*

This letter to the Philippians was written by apostle Paul. At that time, he was imprisoned for the first time in Rome. Though his freedom was taken away, he exhorted the believers to rejoice; this is due to his faith in Jesus Christ. With this faith, believers will be able to rejoice in all circumstances. We don’t only rejoice in good times but also in times of tribulations. Those who met with tribulations rejoiced because they knew that their sufferings were for Christ. 

Jesus’ sermon on the mount said. “Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of God.” Believing in God and practicing our faith is to walk in righteousness with God. Many times, those who keep their faith in Jesus Christ will meet with sufferings and persecutions but such sufferings are for righteousness sake.

Elder Peter also exhorted those who suffer for Christ not to be discouraged. Turn to 1 Peter 3:13-15;

*13 'And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? 
14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.” 
15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; '*

When we suffer for Christ, we are blessed. Even though we meet with threats because of our faith, Peter said to not be afraid. Instead, we should sanctify the Lord Jesus in our hearts. If we practice our faith and meet with tribulation, we need not be afraid but rather rejoice. In 1 Peter 4:12;

*'Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; '*

15; 

*'But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. '*

If we are reproached for the name of Christ, we are blessed. V12 tells us;

*'Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; '*

The way of following Jesus Christ is to take up Christ. Therefore, sufferings are part of our faith and it is only through tribulations that we can follow Christ and enter the kingdom of Heaven. This is why Elder Peter said, “If you are reproached for the name of the Lord, blessed are you!” V14-15; 

*14 'If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. 
15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. '*

If we suffer for righteousness sake, we suffer for Christ; we suffer because we keep the faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we suffer because we love Christ! Such sufferings are glorious. This is why believers will still be able to rejoice. 

## Why do we rejoice in the midst of tribulations?
**1. Because it is through many tribulations we enter the Kingdom of God**  
This was what Paul and Barnabas exhorted the believers. In their first missionary journey, they went to Galatia. As they passed through from one town to another, many came to believe. Then Paul exhorted them to keep strong in their faith though they may meet many tribulations. 

Recall the first martyr in Acts. In Acts 7, Stephen was stoned to death but we remember his death as victorious because he kept his faith to the end. Though his enemies opposed him greatly; planted false witnesses to accuse him; Stephen continued to keep the Word of Truth and proclaimed Jesus. Even when these people were going to stone him, the face of Stephen was likened to the face of an angel; full of serenity. When he looked up to Heaven, a vision was shown to him and he saw Jesus Christ at the right hand of His Father. Stephen was really exhorted and was full of joy. He then told this vision to the people. The people hated him because they were enemies of Christ, and went on to stone him. But Stephen was filled with the peace of the Lord. As he was stoned, he prayed for those who persecuted him as well as for those who stoned him; he asked the Lord to forgive them for they didn’t know what they were doing. 

That was Stephen — full of faith, love from God, and courage. He went through sufferings and finally death by stoning. He suffered all these for Christ and we believe he has a kingdom in heaven. Hence, he was shown a vision when he looked up to heaven, seeing Jesus at the right hand of the Father shows that the salvation was with Stephen. Jesus ascended to heaven and was still interceding for Stephen. This is why Stephen had no fear. In the midst of tribulations, he continued to have hope and rejoice. This is the first reason. 
**2. Because it is through sufferings and tribulations we cultivate spiritual character**
We always say that we must cultivate a spiritual character and only through tribulations we are able to cultivate this spiritual character. In Romans 5:1-5;

*1 'Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 
4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.'*

We need perseverance in tribulations. When everything is well, we don’t need perseverance. It is only in tribulations when things aren’t going well when we need patience to trust in Jesus Christ. This perseverance results in spiritual character. In James 1:1-4; 
 
*1 'James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings. 
2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 
3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 
4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. '*

Here tells us the benefits of tribulations. Tribulations are also a test for our faith. When the test comes upon us is when we need patience and perseverance. When this patience is perfected is when we will lack in nothing. Therefore, tribulation is a way we grow in spiritual character. 

The speaker feels that those who went through tribulations have stronger faith. 
When he first went to the Philippines, he witnessed the poverty the members were going through; he went for 6 trips in 2 years between 1983 to 1985. In 1987, he met the believers who were baptised between 1983 to 1985. They were still poor; some couldn’t afford 3 meals a day. 

The speaker asked them, “How are you?” 
“We are good.”
“You don’t have food, how can you be good?” 

They were hungry but their spiritual character could be seen. Their faith was strong. Though they go through many years of poverty, they kept their faith. 

There was a sister who was a Roman Catholic previously. After her baptism, she took it upon herself to clean church halls, chairs, and floors. As she grew older, one of her wealthy daughters, a 7-day Adventist, who lived in another town wanted to bring her to live with her. The sister refused. Though she would lead a more comfortable life if she moved towns, she rejected it because she wanted to serve God in TJC; because here is where the truth is. The speaker asked her, “Are you not poor?”
“Yes, but thank God.” 

Their patience and endurance can be seen and their spiritual character built up. This sister had passed away. She was a part of the first 24 believers baptised and the older ones among them have kept their faith. 

One of the ladies was the elder of her previous church. She died from cancer and suffered much pain. When she prayed to the Lord, she had no money to consult doctors to receive medication. She then prayed to the Lord, “Your daughter is ashamed to pray in this manner. You suffered so much pain on the cross and we were saved through Your blood. Your daughter is suffering just a little bit of pain from cancer and yet I find it so hard.” Thank God, she kept her faith till the end. 

The church is strengthened because of these elderly sisters. Their spiritual characters were cultivated through tribulations and sufferings. Our lives here in Singapore are very affluent and comfortable. Although we love the Lord, our spiritual characters are that of a child. When we talk about faith, how much faith do we have? When we talk about love, how much is our love likened to that of Jesus Christ? When we talk about sacrifice, we may be able to give up 30 to 40 years to Jesus Christ; but the speaker is still ashamed to say that his sacrifice is not perfect. This is because we are still not perfected spiritually, because we have not gone through real sufferings. The speaker is 74 years old and has not experienced COVID-19 in this entire life except during this year. He is presently living and eating comfortably at home. Our services are currently streamed online and we don’t even have to travel to listen to sermons. 

We say that the Holy Spirit makes us strong. But, if tribulations don’t come upon us, we don’t really need to endure sufferings and our spiritual characters will still remain weak. When we suffer tribulations, we must still rejoice because we will grow in character.

**3. We will receive strength from the Lord and fight the spiritual war well**
Turn to Revelation 7:9;

*'After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, '*

13-17; 

*13 'Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?” 
14 And I said to him, “Sir, you know.” So he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
15 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them. 
16 They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat;
17 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”'*

The first part of Revelation 7 talks about the 144,000. They were sealed by angels. From v9 onwards, the 144,000 grew to become a great multitude which no one could number. They were not just the tribes of Israel but they came from all nations, tribes, people, and tongues. They stood before the throne of God and land, clothed with white robes and palm branches in their hands. These denote their victory in the Lord. This is why they could say in v10;

*'and crying out with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” *

V13-17 explains who were these great multitude of people clothed in white. Why were their garments white? Because they have washed their garments in the blood of Christ. They have also come out from the great tribulation; this is the tribulation seen in Matthew 24. In the end times, the tribulation will be much greater than that of this pandemic. With COVID-19, some have become so fearful they do not know what to do. There doesn’t seem to be any solution and some have taken their own lives as a result; some no longer care for what is about to happen and just live for the day — they drink, don’t wear masks, take their guns and shoot randomly. Some don’t care anymore; just let it be if they have to be sentenced to death. As believers of Christ, we rejoice in tribulations because it is when we receive strength from Christ; it is when we can overcome tribulations. 

Post COVID-19, our lives will be very different and tough but this is not considered a great tribulation. Great tribulations will be much tougher with more sufferings but we need not be afraid because we have a God who cares for us. As long as we have faith to rejoice in the Lord and trust in Him, He will give us strength. The speaker has always wondered about the apostles of Christ; 11 out of 12 died as martyrs. Stephen as a disciple also died as a martyr. Their deaths were not without pain, how did they have the strength and rejoice? The Lord added to their strength so that they know that when they die, they die for Christ and for righteousness sake. Today, we rejoice because of Christ. When we know how to rejoice, we will always have strength in the midst of sufferings. 

## How can we have joy in suffering?

**1. Know assuredly that suffering tribulations for Christ is suffering for righteousness’ sake**  
If we suffer for ourselves, it is not for righteousness’ sake. If we suffer according to the biblical suffering; keeping the word of righteousness, upholding our faith and trust in God, that is suffering for Christ. The reward of the kingdom of heaven is for us. The TJC has the truth, the Holy Spirit, the grace, and mercy of the blood of Christ. All these enable us to walk righteously to our God. Let us examine ourselves, are we truly walking in righteousness? Sometimes the speaker reflects on his deeds and wonders why he acts in such ways. We may term these as “unrighteousness” and “injustice”. It may not be seen of adultery or murder but they are with jealousy, malice, division, and envy hidden in the things we do. We say that we keep the word of God but we are unable to work with each other. Preachers always say, “Do we 同工 or 同攻击?” We always say to walk together (同工), but we are actually attacking one another (同攻击). This is because we lack righteousness. There needs to be total submission to God because it is when we can walk righteously with God. Then, our sufferings are for Christ and righteousness.

**2. Know that the grace of God is sufficient for us**  
These sufferings are only temporary and will not be too great to overcome us because the grace of Christ is always sufficient for us. When COVID-19 began and the death toll kept increasing, there was much fear. In Singapore, we may not feel this fear as much especially when the mortality rate is low and infections are mostly limited to a certain group of people. With most factors in control, we feel safe in comparison to those in other countries. As a result, we do not seek the grace of God as much. If we were in America now where the situation has already lost control; the CDC has no control, the president neglects the advice of the health advisories; there is much more fear. 

Victoria, Australia is now experiencing a second wave; many are trying to move out to another state. Though Western Australia is closed, many have managed to enter still. We don’t know how, but they have ways to. We know that there are many tribulations in the world. We may escape from this pandemic temporarily, but other tribulations will come. What we know for sure is this: God’s grace is sufficient for us. If we know this, we can rejoice. Paul was contended with afflictions and sufferings when God told him, “My grace is sufficient for you.” 

Read 2 Corinthians 12:9-10;

*9 'And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.*

Paul took pleasure in infirmities, reproaches, needs and persecutions. The Lord said, “My grace is sufficient for you.” This was the path the Lord wanted Paul to take. Though Paul needed to go through hardships, he took pleasure in sufferings. When the Lord said, “My grace is sufficient for you,” Paul took pleasure in the aforementioned because he was suffering in the will of God. Our sufferings are not forever and without purpose when we suffer for the Lord. 

**3. Know sufferings are temporary**  
Paul said the temporal sufferings prepare us for the eternal weight of glory in the kingdom of heaven (2 Cor 4:17). In life, we go through sufferings. As compared to the glory to be received in the kingdom of heaven, our sufferings are nothing. Though Paul had to suffer, he had no worries because he knew these sufferings are but a preparation for the eternal kingdom in heaven. As Christians, our sufferings are not for nothing. We don’t just suffer because there is COVID-19 or because the world is cruel, but because God has prepared this for us. 

A few preachers and the speaker went to Myanmar. he was asked, “Why did these people born In Myanmar go through so many sufferings? This place is not for human beings!” We thank God that the group of believers in that place received the Holy Spirit (about 30 of them). A Spiritual Meeting was conducted there and the work of the Holy Spirit was seen. This is the grace of God and it was unseen in the preacher’s country. These people are chosen and God had planned for them to go through such sufferings so that they may receive the grace of the Lord; they can receive the glory of God in the kingdom of heaven if they can keep the faith. Of course, we don’t choose to suffer but if God wills that we need to suffer, let us not murmur. Rather, let us rejoice. When we know how to rejoice, our faith will be sufficient for us to overcome tribulations. 

## What should we be doing to rejoice in tribulation?

**1. Grow to trust in the Lord**  
We always say to trust in the Lord but let it not be just a slogan; act it out. When we meet with troubles, hardships, and setbacks, learn to trust in the Lord. Whether it be an exam, going to church to conduct classes, or church work, remember this: because God has chosen me, I have to learn to trust in the Lord. 

When the speaker just came out to become a FT preacher, he felt inadequate. His Bible knowledge was 0 because he had not attended any RE lessons. Sabbath sermons were also in Chinese dialects and he couldn’t understand what the sermon speaker was saying. But the Lord allowed the speaker to come to SG. He came in April 1970, attended a SM, and received the Holy Spirit. One month later, he came out to study. When the speaker attended the SM, he had no plans to study in SG at all. When the speaker received the Holy Spirit, he knew that he had to be close to the church. Thank God he was given such an opportunity.

In 1977, when the first Bible course in English for preachers was conducted, the speaker thought that it was an opportunity he must take. The entrance exam was not taken before enrolment because they were special students from countries in South East Asia. After enrolment and attending lessons, the exam was taken. Later on, the speaker was given the chance to look at his test papers after finishing his training. The percentage was not just a mere fail but horrible. But the Lord gave him a chance to become a FT preacher and thank God, with trust in the Lord and with His grace, the speaker can serve Him till the day he dies. This is the grace of God and is a period of great joy for the speaker. From the time he entered the theological centre till today is a period of great choice because he is able to trust in a Lord that is so faithful; he always feels that He is always by his side. 

**Though we don’t always get an immediate answer after prayer, when we look back, God has never forsaken us. Though not every prayer gets answered, God has never let us down in the events necessary for us.** This is how God takes care of us. If we are thankful for the Lord, we know that the grace of God is always with us. Then, we can trust in the Lord. Especially in these trying times when the government also said that it will be tough. Even if we have a job, times will be tough. Our children will lead a tough time growing up and the church will also meet with difficulties in upcoming generations. 

**2. Always praise Him and give thanks in all circumstances**  
When Paul and Silas were in prison, they sang hymns to praise God. They were put into the inner prison where their legs were fastened; it wasn’t easy. But they knew how to give thanks and praise God and their faith were strengthened. This is why they had a lot of joy. We have to learn to sing hymns. 

When the speaker was in Taiwan in 1978, the trainee preachers went on an excursion to visit all the hill churches. There were certain places where they had to walk quite a long distance (about 4-5 hours). One day, they were late and the sun had set. In the hills, the torch is useless, especially if you don’t know the way. An experienced preacher who was leading said to walk in the centre of the path and not the side. They then had to cross a monkey bridge to reach the other side where the church was. The preacher said, “Sing [hymns]!” All of them sang loudly. There was a lot of fear in their hearts; they didn’t know where they were going and what was ahead of them. None of them had walked on a monkey bridge before. Thank God they arrived at their destination safely. The next day after the morning session, they left the place. They had to cross the same monkey bridge. Now that there was daylight, they saw how rotten the ropes were and how old the planks were. No wonder the preacher told them to sing loudly. 

When we meditate on the lyrics in hymns, they’ll give us much hope and joy. God loves our singing and that is when you have a lot of joy. Let not hymn singing be something dreary but let us love to sing. 

**3. Pray always to the Lord to light our hearts**  
In Psalm 18:28; 

*'For You will light my lamp; The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.'*

When there is darkness in the heart, there can never be joy. When there is light in the heart, we will rejoice. How can our hearts be like the lamp that is lightened? It is only possible when God lights our lamp because that is when we are full of hope and joy. In Psalm 19:7-8;

*7 'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; 
8 The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;'*

When a person’s heart is in darkness, he is without hope for he cannot see the grace and blessings of God, and he cannot visualise the kingdom of heaven. When our lamps are lit, there is hope. This lamp is lit when the Word of God is a light in our hearts. The latter part of v8 says; 

*The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;'*

When we have the Word of God in our hearts and is lit by the Lord, that becomes the word of life. That is when we have a lot of hope. When we have the Word of God in the midst of tribulations and it shines brightly in our hearts, it will be full of joy. Some of us may be very knowledgeable of the Bible but our hearts are dark because the world has darkened our lamp; we did not allow Jesus Christ to light our lamps. When we study the Word of God, let it not be just knowledge. When we have light of the Lord is when we have hope, salvation, and are able to behold God face to face. Then, the Word of God will become a lamp to our feet and light to our path. We will know what to do and walk according to the will of God. If our lives are conducted according to the will of God, because He has lit our lives up, it will be a life of rejoicing. Even though we may meet with sufferings, we will rejoice.

These 3 things are things we must do, then, we will rejoice.   
**1. Trust in the Lord**    
**2. Praise and sing hymns always**    
Hymns don’t just refer to those in our hymn book. There are many hymns in the Bible - Psalms; short passages written by great men like Moses and David praising God. These are hymns we keep in our hearts. Sing this to the Lord and be joyful!   
**3. Pray always to the Lord to light our hearts**   
Don’t let the world darken our hearts; let the Lord light our hearts.
