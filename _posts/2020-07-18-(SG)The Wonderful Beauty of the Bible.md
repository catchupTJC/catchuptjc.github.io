Summary:  
The speaker explores the three beauties in Psalm 19: God’s creation, the Law of God, and the prayer of the servant, to understand the beauty of the word of God better. 


The objective of this SM is for everyone to love the Bible because the Word of God is wonderful and beautiful; of great help to our spiritual growth and allows us an intimate relationship with God. If you were to read all the books in the world to help you set a direction in life, you will realise that there is no book that can direct you towards eternity. The preciousness of the Bible is that it concerns life. Though the Bible is so important, some Christians look lightly upon it. One day, when we live this world and don’t have the compass from the Bible, can we find the way to life? We don't have to wait for us to die to realise the importance of this Bible. Instead, let us treasure our time on this world to learn the Word of God. The Bible allows us to see the many wondrous beauty of the Word of God and those who read the Bible can feel the wondrous beauty of the Word of God. 

The Bible can help to fulfil the deepest needs of men. We say that men often need mental food, why?   
Because men are not like animals to just need food. Men do not just remain where physical food is. When God created men, He gave men a unique characteristic, that is to have a longing for his needs to be fulfilled in his heart. Besides material needs, what do men need? Jesus said that men don't live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds by the mouth of God. If men don't have the Word of God, he will feel lacking and this can be said to have an imperfect life. If you don’t have life, all is meaningless. The Word of God is a very important nutrient in nourishing our life. If we don’t have the Word of God, we are no different from animals because we aren’t able to join with the life of God. 

Of course, we cannot live forever. King Solomon once said this, “After men have sinned, he lives a short, temporal and difficult life. This has allowed men to know his limitedness and come to fear God.” It is our responsibility to know and keep the Word of God. If we don’t have the Word of God, we’re unable to see the wondrous beauty God has created in our lives. From the Bible we see the wondrous creation because the Bible contains many wonderful things. Sometimes we view external things as important; eating, drinking and dressing well. But physical food cannot allow us to experience the wondrous beauty of God. The Bible is given to us in order to change our lives, not to emphasise on the material beauty; the Bible emphasis on our inner beauty. The Word of God can change a person from a bad temper to good; change the fool to a wise; help you escape from danger to choose the word of life.

Psalm 19 will be used for today’s exhortation. In Psalm 19 we see 3 wondrous beauties God has given us. Psalm 19 was written by David and this chapter can be divided into 3 portions:   

V1-6: God’s creation  
V7-10: The Law of God  
V11-14:The plea/prayer of the servant  

Here also tells us the 3 revelations given by God. God’s creation has given us revelation. The Law of God reveals to men the benefits of the Word of God. Because men have the Spirit that God has given us in His creation, how men are different from animals is that men have a heart of discernment as well as morals; animals don’t have this. 

**Portion 1 — V1-6: God’s creation**

Psalm 19:1-3;   

*1 'The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork.    
2 Day unto day utters speech, And night unto night reveals knowledge.    
3 There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard.'*

V1-3 tells us that besides the creation of God given to men, there is the evidence of God’s wonder and greatness. Here it says, “There is no speech or language for which the voice is not heard.”   

Why is silence better than sound?  
Every day, men can experience God. From creation, men experience the wonder and goodness God gives us, just as the sun shines upon all creation. When men see the magnificent wonder and the awesome creation of the universe, it seems as if it is a silent creation but it can cause men to give off praises from within him to proclaim the greatness of God. When astronauts go up to space and look down on the bluish-green crystal ball, the first thought that comes to them is that there is a God. From the outside, we can see the existence of God through His creation. 

From within our hearts, we can immediately recognise the greatness of God. In Romans 2:15;  

*'who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them*

Paul said that in the hearts of men is the law of discernment. To the Jews, they had the Law. To the Gentiles, they did not have the heart of discernment. Therefore, men are a very unique creation because they have an internal understanding of what is right and wrong. 

Men also have a special appreciation of the wonderful creation that is not found in other created things; this is the wonderful creation of God in one’s life. Such a recognition doesn’t come from men. When God created men, He gave men this feeling. Hence, among all creations of God, only men can appreciate His creation. We don’t find polar bears looking up at the sky and admiring it; we don’t see monkeys coming together to worship God. 

Men have an innate heart to worship God. In Genesis 2:9 tells us;   

*'And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.'*

All the creations God had made were for men. Men like to go to nature to look at the wonderful creation, as if they have an intimate relationship with nature. Some may be under great stress but relax when they meet nature. With a heart of peace and calmness, they appreciate the creation of God. The viewing of such nature allows the heart to be content. In Romans 1:19-20;

*19 'because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.   
20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, '*

God’s creation has already been manifested in men so men cannot say that there is no God. The revelation of Creation tells us that not only there is a God, but also His lovingkindness for us. The wondrous beauty of God helps us to seek Him. 

A testimony:  
A young sister in Taiwan suffered from depression. She felt that there was no hope in life. She is a very talented person but found it difficult to live; such is depression, there is no meaning in whatever one does. 

Once, when she was walking on the overhead bridge, she felt a strength meeting her. She walked and went into a bookshop. There, she took a book and opened it up to read. When she opened the book, she felt as if her entire self was lifted-up. 

(Note that this was a vision)  
She felt that she was lifted up into space where she could view the vastness of the creation; she viewed earth from space. She felt astonished and started to weep. Suddenly she heard a voice telling her, “Do not be afraid, don’t cry. I love you.” She found this wonderful and wept even more. At this time, she felt greatly comforted in her heart and her depression and anxiety left her. When she looked at the book she opened, it was a Bible. After this, she went around looking for various churches but was disappointed because she couldn’t feel the presence of God. Some churches told her that as long as you believe in God, He will give you the Holy Spirit and be with you. She studied the Bible and had doubts for such teachings because she had previously experienced that you can experience God but she did not feel so there. 

In seeking, 12 years quickly passed. She had begun to be disheartened and no longer sought. She then became an accomplished painter in France but didn’t feel happiness in her heart. Because many things happened, she gave up what she had in France and returned to Taiwan. Coincidentally, the France landlord returned with her. He was a member from one of the Taiwan churches and invited her to an evangelistic service. When she did, she saw the church members speaking in tongues. Then her heart told her, “God is here.” She came forward to pray but didn’t receive the Holy Spirit. She longed to pray for the Holy Spirit but didn’t receive. In her prayer she understood that it's because her sins have yet to be washed away. She wanted to baptise but didn’t really understand the Bible. What’s wonderful is that after the service, some truth-seeking friends were asking the believers in front concerning doctrines and they were all questions she wanted to know. One of them was, “Why do you wait now? Arise, call on His name and be baptised!” 

That night, she returned home and continued to pray for the Holy Spirit; she received the Holy Spirit that night. Later on, she registered for baptism and no longer found life meaningless. She felt God’s love and read of the wonderful salvation of God in the Bible. The Word of God filled her heart with hope. She said that it was as if God completely changed her heart; her depression was cured without any medication. 

We see how in this testimony God allowed her to see His wonderful creation. When she saw the lovingkindness of God and compassion, He allowed her to know Him through His beautiful Word.

In the past, she’d make arrangements for her own life. She was very successful and thought that there was nothing she couldn’t accomplish. But one thing she couldn’t do was to fulfil the emptiness in her heart. When you see the wondrous creation of God that created men, not only can men come to know Him through His word, but also see from nature the existence of God so that men may come to seek Him, know Him, and receive His grace. 

We already know the Word of God as well as the wondrous beauty of His words. The question is: do we know how to love the Word of God? Do we find the Bible boring? Have we allowed the wondrous beauty of God's world to know Him even more? Do we often feel this joy of salvation when we read HIs word? Or have the pressures of life alkyd caused us to lose sight of the wondrous grace of God? 

**Portion 2 — The Law of God is perfect**

This is one benefit of God’s word for us. He can refresh the heart of men so the foolish can become wise. This all help men to walk the way of life and this is sweeter than honey. The Word of God is beautiful and wonderful. Pr Shee had reminded us that the Old Testament and New Testament unifies together to show the beauty of God’s words. The books of the Old Testament also testify the works of God. The Old Testament and New Testament  continually testify for God’s grace. Ephesians 2:20 tells us that we were built on the foundation of the prophets (Old Testament) and apostles (New Testament). The Word of God has been completely entrusted to us and it gives us the wisdom and knowledge to escape from sin. It is as if we’ve seen the sun; the Word of God shines on us so we no longer walk the way of darkness to escape the temptation of Satan. 

When we read the Word of God, it is sweeter than honeycomb. Through the Word of God, we will hate false teachings. The teachings of men completely differ from men’s because what they think is beautiful may not be the most beautiful. The Word helps us discern right and wrong. This world is wicked and full of half-truths. Very easily, Christians can be easily misled and Satan will use all means to cause us to sin. Satan will tell us, “It’s most important to satisfy your needs!” He told Eve that she didn't need to listen to the Word of God; when did He say this? Will we allow the wonderful Word of God to escape teethings that harm us?

Not only must we love the Word of God, we must also understand the Word of God. When we understand the Word of God, we will find it beautiful, wonderful and sweet; we will have true peace and freedom. What's wonderful is not doing whatever we please and give way to lust and passion. The perfect law of God reminds us that we don’t do things that harm us. The pleasures of this world is for a moment but the Word of God is eternal. We know all these teachings but ironically, we sometimes fall because of this. 

Why is it that men still fall though they know?   
During the speaker’s time, there is a kind of insect that gives off a luminous blue colour; often found in bins and can fly. They’d fly over bins looking for cockroaches; cockroaches are scared of them though cockroaches are larger in size. When these insects find cockroaches, they’ll sting them with their tail. After a while, the cockroach will be unable to move. When this luminous insect stings the cockroach, it releases endorphins. When the endorphin reaches the brain, the cockroaches will not be able to move. Then, they’ll bring the cockroaches back and then sting it the second time. They are actually laying eggs on them. Then they bury the cockroaches, and later use the cockroaches as food. 

During the process, the cockroach doesn’t feel fear but excitement due to the endorphin. This is frightening. Isn’t sin like this? It allows you to fulfil your passions and lusts; you are drunk in sin and die in it. Because men greed after the pleasures of life, they only look before their eyes instead of long-term. God has given men the wonderful revelation but if men don't seek to understand the complete Word of God, they will give way to their lusts. It is very much like the cockroaches. 

We are unable to allow the Word of God to change our lives into a wonderful and beautiful one unless we’re very willing to submit to the Word of God. Simply put, we must love the Word of God and keep the Bible. The Word of God is like a light shining to our lives to help us see all the things that harm us. 

Thailand is a country that consists mostly of Buddhists. In the 19th century around 1830, there was a Thai prince who went to England to study. While studying abroad, he came into contact with Christianity. At that time, one of the Christian associates/Bible societies came to know about it. They then came to look for him because at that time, Christianity had yet to enter Thailand; there was also no Thai Bible yet. They then sought the help of this Thai prince to translate the Bible into Thai. At that time, there were Buddhist monks to serve the palace. There were also few in Thailand who knew English. The monks who served in the palace not only knew English but also graduated from universities; they had deep research studies into culture, etc. 

When the monks heard of this, they thought that since they were Buddhists and the other Christians, they would not get along. However, since it’s the request of the prince, they reluctantly agreed when Bible societies came to talk to the Thai monks. However, there were 3 conditions:   
If the monks find any contradictions in the Bible against Buddhism, they will stop the work   
If the monks don’t feel good during the translation, they’ll stop   
After finishing the translation, the monks are to be given some money so that they may offer it to the temple  
Because they were in a rush, the Bible society agreed. During the process, there were many Bible scholars involved. There were also ups and downs because sometimes the monks didn’t feel good and hence went away. 

Then, they finally came to the gospel according to Luke. When they read Luke 23 where Jesus was nailed to the cross, the monks started to weep deeply. They were shocked at the monk. They didn’t expect the monk to say this, “Lord, I’m a sinner!” Later, he accepted Christianity and translated the first Thai Bible. The edition is named, “The Monk Version”. The point is that the Bible was miraculously translated. The Word of God is beautiful and wonderful. For someone who totally didn’t believe in Jesus was changed completely. The Bible allowed him to see his own sin. 

**Portion 3 — The plea/prayer of the servant**

What was this psalmist praying and longing for? V12-13;

*12 'Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults.   
13 Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, And I shall be innocent of great transgression.'*

The Word of God can allow us to see our error. Regarding the sin of men can be divided into 3 types:  
The sins you’ve already committed; you may know but others may not know  
You have already decided to commit the sin in your mind but have yet to act  
You don’t know that your heart is filled with sin; sin hidden within you and yet to be manifested 
Who will know our hidden sins? The Word of God can eliminate the darkness in our hearts. Hebrews 4:12-13; 

*12 'For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.   
13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.'*

Here it tells us that the Word of God is living and powerful; able to discern all the hidden things of men because it can pierce into the darkest place of men. Nothing can be hidden before Him for all creation in the world has been created by the Word of God. The Bible has been revealed to men and the thoughts of men have been given to us. Isn’t this such a revelation that is so wonderful? 

We have seen the wonderful revelation of God, let us turn our footsteps back to Him. God has created all things beautiful in His time and in Ecclesiastes the preacher says that He has put eternity into the hearts of men. If we look at all the creation of the world, we see the eternity of God. How can the hearts claim that there is no God? The Word of God is wondrous and beautiful and nature, the Bible, and our conscience reveals this to us. The purpose is for us to love reading the Bible and to once again reestablish God’s righteousness and image in us. Not only should we not allow sin to influence us, we should also use our lives to change this world to save more men to come to know Him. 

May God help us to understand the beautiful Word of God.
