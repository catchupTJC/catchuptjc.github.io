Summary:  
The three parables in Matthew 25 give us important lessons to think about in the last days.   
1. Are we prepared to endure to the end and shine as light even in the darkest tribulation?   
2. Are we fully utilising the time and abilities God has given us to serve Him?  
3. Are we being sincere in our service? Do we truly know what it means to serve the Lord?  

Matthew 24 and 25 talk about the second coming of Christ. It reminds us that as the day of His coming approaches, we need to be prepared so that when He comes, He finds us acceptable. Jesus once asked, “when the son of Man comes, will He find faith in the earth?” Usually Matthew 25 is summarised into these three themes.  
1. Spiritual nurture (Christian conduct)  
2. Service to the Lord (Christian ministry)  
3. Loving our fellow men (Christian love)  
But there’s deeper insight. These three parables are put side by side because there are inter relationships. We must appreciate the full message they convey together. One thing that is common about the three parables is that they talk about failure to do what is necessary.  

**Parable of virgins: failure to be prepared to meet the groom**  
**Parable of talents: failure to fully use the abilities given to us to serve Him**  
**Parable of sheep & goats: failure to act kindly and lovingly to those in need**  

We often say every action has its consequences. These three parables tell us that when we are supposed to act yet fail to act, our actions would have grave consequences. It drives home the point that those who are saved are doers of the word and not just hearers of the word. In the previous chapter (Matt 24), Jesus talks about a faithful servant who did what he was supposed to until his master came.

## Parable of the virgins 
Why are the virgins foolish? This parable is not just about spiritual nurture. The 10 virgins had their work to do. There were some preparations they had made - they carried lamps that were burning. Their work was to wait for the bridegroom to come. They were supposed to go out to meet the bridegroom. We do not know if they were waiting midway, but when the midnight cry came about, they were supposed to go out to meet Him. This is not just about spiritual nurture, but indicating that we must go out to do our work. The work was to light up the path and lead the bridegroom into the house. The five foolish virgins had inadequate preparation and hence were unable to finish the work. Although being wakeful is important, even the five wise virgins also fell asleep. But they were finally accepted in the house, because they were able to complete what they were supposed to do. They had enough oil and could make the distance into the house. This was the work they were supposed to do. There was some distance away to meet the bridegroom hence why they needed more oil. This coming of the groom is not referring to Jesus coming again and then the virgins fumble to go get oil. It is not that they are rejected after going to get Spirit-filled. Jesus is retelling the story from what he taught in chapter 24.

Matt 24:36    
*But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.*

Let's take a look at the Jewish wedding customs of the times of Jesus. There are 2 aspects in a Jewish marriage. One is the betrothal, the other is the wedding. The betrothal is about 12 months ahead of the wedding. After the betrothal, both parties have a strong obligation to each other. They are not supposed to have a relationship with any other, and in the eyes of the society around them, they are considered husband and wife. To the bride, this is great assurance. She would be excitedly preparing for the day of her wedding, for the day when the bridegroom comes to her house to take her to his home. But they would not have agreed on the date. When they get engaged, they do not know when they would get married, as it is the father of the groom that decides on the date. Even the groom does not know. Jesus uses this to talk about His second coming. "Only the Father knows". Because all the arrangements must meet the requirements of the father of the groom. When he is satisfied, he will give the approval, and then he tells the groom, now you can make your way to your wife's house. When the date is decided, in order not to make it too surprising to the wife, a messenger would be sent to the house of the bride, to announce that the groom would be making his way there. So that the bride and virgins (bridesmaids) would have ample time to make themselves ready. From the time of the betrothal to the time of the wedding, the bride would have made a lot of preparations already, but on that day she would have to make her final preparations. The groom would leave his house with a large entourage, with shouting, and the blowing of trumpets. The virgins were supposed to welcome the groom by going out to meet him.

Chapter 24 says that the second coming of the Lord will happen unexpectedly. Some people would be unprepared. We must not be one of those who are unprepared. Jesus says there would be clear signs of His soon arrival.  

Matt 24:32-33    
*Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors!*
There are clear signs of His coming, just like the messengers who would arrive at the doorstep of the bride and announce that the groom is going to make his way here. We must learn from the parable of the fig tree; when the leaves are put forth, the groom is coming. In fact, there are very early signs as well.

Matt 24:8    
*All these are the beginning of sorrows.*
These are very early signs - before the fig tree bears forth leaves. Every one of us, when we are baptised into the Lord, we become part of the team of the bride of Christ. This bride is called the bride of Christ because she is already betrothed, waiting for Jesus to consummate the wedding. From the time of the betrothal until the time when the heavenly bridegroom comes, it is the time for the church to make her preparations.
For us individually, from the day of our baptism, we will have to start preparing, like the virgins. So that when Jesus comes again we will not be unprepared. Then we will see the beginning of sorrows, then we see the fig tree putting forth its leaves, like the messengers coming to the bride's house. The 10 virgins received early news that the groom is coming his way. And so they prepared. The five wise virgins were fully prepared, if he came in the morning, evening, they were ready. Even in slumber they were ready. Here they were not penalised for their slumber. Jesus was not saying that these people weren't watchful. They slumbered because they worked so hard, were tired and needed rest. Let's not look at their slumber like Elijah or Noah. Look at Jesus. He was also asleep at the stern of the boat. He was a hard working man. But when they woke Him up, immediately He could still the storm, do the work they asked Him to do. Like these 5 wise virgins, they were ready. Quickly they trimmed the lamps, they had extra oil and brought the groom into the house. It's ok that they were sleeping at the time. They were fully ready. When they were sleeping, there was this midnight cry. In Matt 24, it says that just before Jesus appears in heaven there will be a great tribulation. It will be so great that unless the days are shorter, no one will be saved. What's the effect of the great tribulation? See v29. The sun would be darkened, stars will fall from heaven. After this great tribulation, the son of Man will appear.

Rev 6:13    
*And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.*
When the great tribulation happens, it is just like the messenger saying, the bridegroom is making his way to your house. It is the darkest of nights and one cannot do anything else but go out and face the issues. Go out bravely and meet your bridegroom. This midnight call wakes up all the virgins. When the tribulation comes, we would be awakened. The tribulation comes suddenly. Are we prepared? Will we be like the 5 foolish or wise virgins? Will we be like the stars that fall? Like the 5 virgins that were rejected? Will we be like the fig that firmly holds on to the fig tree or will we be the fig tree that has no figs? It depends on whether we are prepared when the tribulation comes. Now is the time for us to be prepared. We are supposed to be prepared for midnight. For a sudden cry, that the groom is coming! You don't see the groom yet, so go out and meet Him. We have to be ready. To complete our final task. To be victors in the middle of the night! The five wise virgins had enough oil to keep their lamps burning. They are said to be wise.

How does the bible describe wisdom?   
Prov 6:6-10   
*Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, Which, having no captain, Overseer or ruler, Provides her supplies in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest. How long will you slumber, O sluggard? When will you rise from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep—*

What's the meaning of being wise? The opposite of laziness.  
v11-12  
*So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler, And your need like an armed man. A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth;*
Here talks about the worthless wicked man. How is this related to the sluggard? These two people will meet with calamity, sudden trouble, sudden end. A wise person will not meet with sudden calamity and end. A wise person is not like a sluggard. Somehow, a wise person is also compared with a wicked person here. Why? A wise person has the fear of God with him. He lives his life in the fear of God and hence lives righteously. When Jesus comes, He comes as the judge and will see if you are righteous or not.

Eccl 2:14  
*The wise man’s eyes are in his head, But the fool walks in darkness. Yet I myself perceived That the same event happens to them all.*
The wise person has light, the foolish does not have light. Light means good works. We are sons of light. We don't do shameful things. Jesus Himself says, in an earlier chapter of Matthew.

Matt 5:14-16  
*“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.*  

We are the light of the world. Let our light shine before men. So that men will see our good works and glorify God. Wisdom is linked to righteousness, to light. Light is our good works. Our Christian behaviour that will glorify God. Can we glorify God in this fierce tribulation? In this last period of time when we shine in this dark age. We have been shining so far. But now this is the last leg, the last stretch. Shouldn't we shine more brightly? Only when we have enough oil are we prepared to let our light shine before men. Will we be able to shine in this dark time?  
It all depends on the amount of courage, strength we have built up. This parable is about enduring to the very end. We must not let our faith and courage fade.

Matt 24:13    
*But he who endures to the end shall be saved.*  
5 of the virgins endured to the end. But 5 could not.

## Parable of the talents
This is about steady service throughout our Christian life. The moment we become a Christian, we become a servant. The moment we receive salvation from the Lord, God has entrusted us our duties. To some, He gives 5 talents. To some, He gives 2 talents. To some 1 talent.

Matt 25:14  
*For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.*  
In the English bible, 'kingdom of heaven' is italicised. The words in italics in the Bible mean they are not originally there. This shows Jesus is continuing the story of the virgins but is phrasing it another way. Both talk about being prepared to meet the Lord at the second time. It is about our life of steady service and giving of our best. In the end, we can endure to the end. Giving our best means, although we are given different amounts of resources, when we put in our best, then 5 talents will not gain 4. It will gain 5. 2 talents will not gain 1, it will gain 2. That happens when we put in our best.

2 Cor 8:12  
*For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have.*   

As long as we are willing to do what God wants us to do, it will be accepted according to what we have. If we have 5 talents and we gain 5 talents, this is expected. But if we have 2 talents, the master will not say, you must also gain 2 talents. Because you have only been given 2. But if you have been given 2 talents, yet gain only 1 talent, you have not put in your best. You will be greatly rewarded if you gain what you have. 5 gain 5 is the same as 2 gain 2. But we see the one given 1 talent, "you are wicked and lazy" Wickedness and laziness is linked here too. When Jesus ended in chapter 24, He asked, "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season?"  

We read about the wise virgins, and now we read about the faithful servants. V48 - the evil servants. This evil servant is lazy. Laziness is a form of wickedness in the eyes of God. He is not using the resources given to him to profit the Lord's work. He is not just foolishly lazy. He is wickedly lazy. To many of us, time is our most valuable resource. What do we do with our time? God has given us a lot of resources. Time is life. God gives us life, we have time. What do we do with our life? The gifts that He gives us are different. But the question is, what do we do with our time? Are we like the rich fool, to build up his barns and store his treasures? In the end, Jesus says "you are not rich toward God, you are poor" We do not make real profits out of what God has given us.

Matt 25:30   
*And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’*  
Aren't we saved by grace? So this servant didn't do work and he's cast out? Is this not contradictory to salvation by grace? No. Forgiveness is free. We already owe God a lot. But He cancels all our debts. Citizenship in the heavenly kingdom is free. Unlike some who could buy Roman citizenship during the time of Jesus. After we have been saved, we receive the honored chance to serve. To be able to serve God is an honour. Unlike corrupt secular governments, where positions can be bought, in our case, we don't have to pay and it can't be bought. But if we despise this position of honour as a servant of God and we do nothing, we are despising this honorable position! Then we will be judged.

## Parable of goats and sheep
The parable of the talents is about not working at all because you don't know your Lord. Do we think our Lord is this hard man? We don't know the Lord and so we think it's ok to lay idle his resources? He has committed the resources to us to do profit making in His kingdom.
For this parable, the parable of goats and sheep, it is about those who have done many things. They have done many things, but yet, it is considered that they have not done anything, because they don't know their work.

Matt 25:44-45  
*Then they also will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’*
They were not aware they had not done the work. To them, they had done a lot. Are not many of us like that? We pray everyday. We don't miss any service. We have done our part in honouring God in our worship. We even serve in the church. We do so many things in the church. BUT, you have not taken care of ME (is what Jesus said). Because we do not know how to do, what to do, in order to truly serve Christ. v46 - they will also go into everlasting torment. Do we find this punishment too harsh? This is well deserved.  

1 Jn 4:20-21   
*If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.*
You don't love your brethren! It is like the priest and levite who left the guy to die on the roadside, giving the excuse that they were going to the temple. 

1 Jn 4:7-8   
*Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.*  
Those who were like the goats on the left, did not know God. They do not love. They are not born of God. How can someone who is not born of God enter into the heavenly kingdom? Their place is in everlasting punishment.

Let's pray that we know what we should do in order to truly serve God. Let us pray so that we have the strength to serve God sincerely and to the very end.
