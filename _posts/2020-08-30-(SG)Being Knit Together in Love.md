Summary:  
“The greatest of these is love”! For the church to be strong, love is needed in…  
1. **facing internal problems**: members may attack or misunderstand each other because they lack the love to bear all things  
2. **facing external problems**: members may incorrectly bear with heresies because they don’t understand love does not rejoice in iniquity!  
3. **leaders and church workers**: it can be difficult to show love to those you’ve never seen face to face before, or to show love to those you’ve seen face to face but the more you love them, the less they love you. Paul showed love in both cases; let us emulate him.

Col 2:1-3, 19  
*For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.*  
*and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God.*

When Paul wrote this letter, his hope and continuous striving was for the members in Colosse and Laodecia. He wants to assure the members hearts will be encouraged and knit together in love; attaining the full understanding of the mystery of God, so that they will have this full assurance. We must note that the church of Colosse was not one with internal problems. While they had no internal problems Paul still wanted them to be knit together in love so they can attain the full understanding of the knowledge of mystery of God. 

Col 1:3-5  
*We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints; because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel*

Upon reading these few verses, we immediately know the Colosse church was an exemplary one. They were known to the people for the 3 virtues listed here - love for all the saints, faith they had in Christ Jesus, hope they had placed in heaven. Faith, hope and love. While the church was exemplary, they were facing problems as people who believed in Gnosticism were attacking them. So much so that the divinity and preeminence of Jesus as the Christ had to be explained to the Colosse church. They were also under attack by those know by the Judaisers who believed gentile Christians had to keep the Mosaic law too e.g. they had to be circumcised. 

Paul wanted the church to receive God’s will to receive knowledge and understanding. He wanted the church to be knitted together in love; to be united. 

Speaker shares: When I read this passage, I started to think about other things. Faith, hope and love, as well as being knit together in the body, seemed to be themes that are similar to another group of people Paul had to write to. This church he wrote to wasn’t exemplary like the Colosse church. They had internal problems; issues within the brethren; members against the members. But the encouragement of Paul still centred around faith, hope and love, and the body being knit together. At this juncture, I thought about the Corinthian church. 

When we think about the Corinthian church, we’re sure it’s a church filled with many problems. For example there was sectarianism - people who formed groups that didn’t get along in the church. This was  repeated few times in 1 Cor. They were also problematic because there was a lot of pride in the church. They sought for spiritual gifts not for the benefit of the church but to show off. Another problem was that immorality was rampant and the church allowed it to remain in the church. Issues in the church were so bad, brethren sued brethren! The Corinthian church members were self-serving; they only thought about themselves. That’s why Paul had to show how he gave up many rights he could’ve gotten from them but didn’t claim. There was also a lack of order in the church (head coverings, conduct during Holy Communion). There were many problems in the Corinthian church, but Paul still used the same kind of imagery and virtues to highlight to the Corinthian church. 

In Colosse, he wrote the whole body should be knit together, holding fast to the Head so that they may be nourished. What connects everything together is actually love. Paul more or less used the same analogy in Corinthians. 

1 Cor 12
Paul used the imagery of the church as the body of Christ to explain the concept of: although there’s the same Holy Spirit of God, different people will receive different gifts. Therefore there are different members of the body; each part fulfils a different function. If members work together, it’s for the betterment of the body. 

1 Cor 12:20-27  
*But now indeed there are many members, yet one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty, but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it, that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.*

This is the message Paul had for the Corinthian church. While he doesn’t use the fact the body is knit together in love, he’s somehow going to suggest it later on. At the end of chapter 12 he says, “I will show you a more excellent way.” Then comes 1 Cor 13 - the chapter of love. 

1 Cor 13 is often brought up during a marriage sermon or ceremony. 

1 Cor 13:4-7  
*Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.*

Often we say this is the definition of love. Using this definition and thinking it in the context of a marriage is applicable and meaningful, because you need to be patient when you’re married to someone else who’s different from you. You also need to show kindness and so on and so forth. It makes sense. But if we read the passage in context with 1 Cor, we realise it’s even more than a relationship between husband and wife. It’s so important for the church, especially for the Corinthian church which has so many problems. It’s this kind of love that’s able to knit the whole body of Christ together. If we think about the problems the Corinthians had, we realised it’s because they lacked love. If the members of Corinth had love like in 1 Cor 13, they would not have had the problems they faced. 

*“Love suffers long/is patient”*

The Corinthian members were suing one another because they couldn’t bear the other person and lacked patience. If they had love, they wouldn’t even consider suing the other person. 

*“Love does not envy. Love does not parade itself. Love is not puffed up.”*

The Corinthian church was filled with so much pride, they formed groups. “If Paul/Peter is my leader who’s the greatest, I want to associate with that!” 

The issue of pursuing spiritual gifts was to boast to others they were gifted by God. 

If they had love as defined clearly here, the problems in Corinth would not have existed.

*“Love does not behave rudely (i.e. doesn’t do things that are shameful) / does not act improperly towards others”*

We consider the issues in the Corinthian church again. Bringing each other to court is definitely being rude. 

*“Love does not seek its own / not self-seeking/serving”*

Paul had to encourage them they he did not seek his own; even though he had the right to demand them to provide for him, he didn’t. He also reminded them to bear others’ in mind when committing certain action lest they cause them to stumble.

*“Love does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth”*

A very important definition of love. The Corinthian church was willing to accept people who were so sinful they should have been excommunicated by right. It seemed loving but it wasn’t because love doesn’t rejoice in iniquity. Love should rejoice in the truth. Love for the brethren should be so strong, it’s demonstrated by removing the sinner because a little leaven leavens the whole lump.

Who has the love as defined here? Jesus definitely. Paul, when writing to the Corinthian church, also displayed this love. He truly loved the Corinthian believers. 

“Do you want me to come to you in wrath? I’d rather come to you in peace!” He shows patience. 

Paul demonstrated love by telling the Corinthian church to get rid of the leaven that might leaven the whole lump. 

Learning points:  
1. Love is needed in a church that’s facing internal problems. When a church seems to have members attacking members and misunderstand each other, inhibiting the church from growing, it’s because the church lacks love. It’s because the members do not love by this definition, especially how love doesn’t rejoice in the truth. The church has an incorrect love that’s forbearant to those who ought to be removed. They lack love that’s not strong enough to protect the members who need help; it doesn’t bear all things. 

2. Love is also needed in a church facing external threats (like the Colossians). If the whole church is not united and knitted in love; it doesn’t rejoice in the truth; it doesn’t have iniquity, then it would be difficult to defend against the outward threats. When heresies come into the church and take root, it’s because the leaders do not differentiate and are not clear how to deal with heretical preachers and members influenced by them. 

3. Love is needed in leaders and church workers. It’s definitely not an easy thing for Paul to deal with the Corinthian church. For the Corinthian church, Paul personally knew them. But then there were so many problems to deal with, he had to take the hard stance to scold and encourage them. He had to take many extreme stances because of his love for them. For the members in Colosse, it was a little different. Paul may not have met many of those in Laodecia and Colosse face to face. But still he had enough love to protect them from the heretical teachings the Colosse were facing.

Which is more difficult? To show love to those you’ve never seen face to face, or to show love to those you’ve seen face to face but the more you love them, the less they love you?

Whatever it is, it’s not an easy thing. It’s important for us to realise we truly need this kind of love. So whatever situation we face with, whether internal problems within church or the facing of external problems, we’re knitted together to face it. 

Let’s learn to be like Paul, to truly love all the members and churches of God.
