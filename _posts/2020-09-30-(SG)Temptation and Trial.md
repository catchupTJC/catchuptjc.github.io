Summary:  
The purpose of temptations and trials are different. To better understand the differences between the two, we look at 3 examples in the Bible - Eve, Job and Jesus. May we learn to (1) overcome our lusts, (2) persevere and be steadfast, (3) be victorious through love.

In the original text, the word for temptation and trial is the same. In Genesis, the serpent is described to be crafty. The word for ‘craftiness’ has different meanings. This shows some words in the Bible’s text can have different meaning. The same word in different contexts can have different meanings. 

The word ‘temptation’ has a negative connotation. It comes from the devil. He wants to tempt men. He wants us to not believe in the word of God. He wants us to walk in the flesh and sin. 

But trials can come from God. Its purpose is to allow our faith to grow, and test our faith towards God. 

Let us take a look at examples of trials in the Bible.

Gen 22:1-2  
*Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”
And he said, “Here I am.”
Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”*

The Bible records that God TESTED Abraham. It’s evident God tests men. What’s the purpose of God giving men free will? It gives men the ability to choose; it’s an opportunity for men to show whether he believes in the word of God; whether he truly believes in God. The purpose of God’s test is to be edified, and to build up our reliance and trust in Him. 

Exo 16:4  
*Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.*

God sent manna down for the Israelites. In the process, He tested the people to see if they would listen and walk in His law. But some people were ‘afraid of losing out’ and failed to pass the test. 

Exo 17:2  
*Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, “Give us water, that we may drink.”
So Moses said to them, “Why do you contend with me? Why do you tempt the Lord?”*

The people tempted the Lord. Not only does God test men, men also test God. Men are not supposed to, but they did. 

The purpose of temptations and trials are different. To better understand the differences between the two, we look at 3 examples in the Bible, that we may be victorious. 

## 1. Eve’s temptation
Gen 3:1-7  
*Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”
And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ”
Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.*

Eve ate of the fruit God instructed them not to eat of. She fell to the temptation. She knew she was not allowed to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; she said it herself to the serpent. But she was shaken in holding on to the word of God. The book of James reminds us we are tempted by our own desires. We have free will. We make the choice whether to obey or disobey the word of God. Adam, too, fell into sin because he heeded the word of his wife. 

Today, we must consistently remind ourselves in our life of faith. There are many things God instructs us not to do. Do we obey the word of God and make the right choice? What is allowed and what isn’t? Do we understand that? 

After falling into temptations, some Christians not only not repent, they even say: it’s hard to make a living in this world! They push the blame to the circumstances they are in. 

Isn’t this the exact same thing Adam and Eve did? Adam said, “It’s the woman You created!” Eve said, “It’s the serpent who deceived me!” The serpent didn’t say a word; he didn’t need to make any excuses because he indeed did cause them to sin. But God doesn’t accept these excuses. Let us be watchful in all things in life. Let’s not relax and lose our salvation due to sin. 

A Christian asked a preacher, “I’ve done this and this and this. What can I do?”
“Don’t you know you’re not supposed to do this?”
“It was due to the circumstances. I had no choice.”
“Why were you in such circumstances?”
“My work required me to go to such a place. One was on my left, one was on my right. One before me.”
When put in such a situation,

When men fall into temptation, it’s mostly his own choice. Nobody told him to go to such a place and place himself in such a situation. No one made Eve take the fruit. 

The choice is in a person’s hands. 

Did the serpent bind her hand and make her take the fruit? She need not have fallen into temptation. She could have walked away from the tree. 

Sadly, men prefer to walk in their own temptations rather than listen to the word of God. 

Youths need to be really careful. There are so many things on the internet. You have the choice on what you click on. 

We may ask: Why did God not allow men to eat of the fruit? It doesn’t seem so bad. What’s wrong with knowing good and evil like God?

How would one know good and evil? The fruit differentiates men who would rather obey the word of God. A man who eats it means he rejects God’s definition of good and evil. 

Temptations make us fall into trouble. If we just walk in our own desires and sin, the outcome would be destruction. 

How can we overcome this?

Jas 4:7  
*Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.*

If we submit to God and resist the devil, the devil has no way to harm us. 

Just like Eve’s situation. If the serpent said all that to Eve and retorted, “I’m going to tell God what you said!”, she would not have fallen. 

## 2. Job’s test
Job 1:6-11  
*Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”
So Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”
Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”
So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”*

Satan’s job involves walking back and forth. In Peter, it says Satan is like a roaring lion prowling about seeking who he may devour.

Satan said Job only praised God because he was blessed. God allowed all Job had to be in Satan’s power, but not to lay a hand on his person.

v12 *And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”
So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.*

Satan stopped going to and fro because he now had a Job to do (LOL)

v13-21  
*Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house; and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. And he said:
“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
And naked shall I return there.
The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;
Blessed be the name of the Lord.”*

Despite all the calamities Satan imputed upon Job, Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong. 

2:1-3  
*Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”
Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”
Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”*

Satan now said Job still held fast to God because his skin wasn’t touched. God allowed Job to be in Satan’s hand, but to spare his life. Notice when Satan wants to do anything, he needs permission from God. 

v7 *So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.*

Job had painful boils all over his body. 

v9-10  
*Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.*

Job was not like Adam, he didn’t heed the voice of his wife. Instead, he rebuked his wife. In all this Job did not sin with his lips.

While Job was bearing great physical suffering, the greatest suffering was in his mind. He couldn’t understand why God allowed him to go through this suffering. 

When we meet with problems, we will naturally try to seek an answer. We will ask many questions and try to find many answers. But we must know the understanding of men is limited. 

When God spoke to Job, He didn’t give him a direct answer. But out of it all, even though Job didn’t completely understand, he understood God is good. 

Job 31:4-6  
*Does He not see my ways,
And count all my steps?
“If I have walked with falsehood,
Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
Let me be weighed on honest scales,
That God may know my integrity.*

It really wasn’t easy for Job. The concept of eternal life wasn’t clear then. Today, 
We also have the Holy Spirit abiding with us as the Counsellor today. We can look forward to eternal life. Despite all these, when we meet with tests/trials, it’s hard for us to accept!

The book of Job teaches us how worshipping God transcends beyond the needs of our physical life. Job went through much physical turmoil and didn’t understand why this was happening to him. But he understood God’s goodness.

Job 40:8  
*Would you indeed annul My judgment?
Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?*

Job 42:1-2  
*Then Job answered the Lord and said:
“I know that You can do everything,
And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.*

Job understood he was but dust and the will of God cannot be stopped. 

v5 *“I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear,
But now my eye sees You.*

Not that Job really saw God, but he really understood God. Men has no right to question the absolute God. Even if men don’t understand all the time, we can’t accuse God of unrighteousness. God is good and righteous. 

The devil’s concept is that the relationship between men and God is based on benefits. “If God doesn’t bless me, I won’t worship Him!” Our relationship with God shouldn’t be based on benefits but on righteousness.

Being able to meet God was a greater blessing than the sufferings Job went through. Job proved Satan wrong.

## 3. Jesus’ temptation
Jesus temptations, from the one Satan tempted Him with in the wilderness to the crucifixion.

While Job was a righteous man, the man who was truly righteous is Jesus. Job died at 140 years old. Job was a righteous man on earth. But Jesus was a sinless man. He’s God who came down as man on earth to die for our sins. 

While we ask, “Why do I need to suffer?”, we should also ask, “Why does Jesus need to suffer?” 

When we sin, we are deserving of suffering. But Jesus? He didn’t do it out of any benefits. Love was the sole reason. 

The Lord Jesus was able to overcome all temptations. He did everything willingly. He did it joyously! He rejoices when we sinners are able to enter into salvation. He was filled with joy in the sufferings He had to go through. 

1 Pet 4:1-2  
*Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.*

The Christians were going through a lot of sufferings then. Peter encouraged them by reminding them of Christ who suffered. 

1 Pet 1:6-7  
*In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ*

If Christians go through sufferings because of the Lord, rejoice! Better to suffer for Christ than to suffer because of our own wrongdoing.

Love is something that helps us to overcome trials. It’s not just about what benefits we can receive. We have to learn the perseverance of Job. Let’s also be watchful not to be like Adam and Eve who fell into their desires. 

3 concluding statements:
1. Overcome our lusts
2. Persevere and be steadfast
3. Be victorious through love
