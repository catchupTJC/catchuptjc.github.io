Summary:  
Let us be mindful of the impact and influence we have on the people around us. We may think: "This is my life. I can do whatever I want. Don’t take away my freedom!” But there is a role in our lives to participate in the work of saving souls and strengthening the people around us. Some people may ask, “God is powerful. Why can’t He do it Himself?” It’s for our own good, so that as we partake in these things, we can grow as a Christian. Put on the armour of light to protect ourselves and to draw people who are true worshippers of God in.

Shakespeare said, “All that glitters is not gold.”

This simply means we cannot judge things based on its outward appearance; its true value is not based on that. 

During Shakespeare’s time, few things shined and glittered. So if anything was found to be so, it was regarded as precious. Today with technological advancements, however, many things can be made to glitter. Are we able to be discerning?

The news have recorded many cases of scams recently. The reason why scams work is because it’s packaged nicely, until it looks like the real thing. For example, phishing works by replicating the true website. Honey traps entice people with something they desire e.g. get-rich-fast schemes. They seem so real, because they’ve been packaged well.

Scams are well orchestrated. They find out a lot of information about you - your loved ones, your income, etc. Many have fallen prey to scams and the impact can be severe. 

Besides physical loss, it may also have a psychologically effect on you - anxiety, fear, shame for falling for it. Some effects are so severe, it costs people their lives - they commit suicide. Some elderly people lose their life’s savings. Some people cannot bear the embarrassment of being scammed.

Do not think there were fewer scams last time because people were wiser. Scammers will devise more and more ingenious ways to trick people.

2 Cor 11:13-15
*For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.*

Paul had to repeat himself many times for the purpose of ensuring the believers could discern between a true and false worker of God.

v1, 16  
*Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly—and indeed you do bear with me.*  
*I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.*

v3  
*But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.*

People were asked to differentiate real and fake diamonds. One person used the following method: he drew a line on a piece of paper and placed the sample diamond on it. If the line cannot be seen, it’s a real diamond. This is based on the reflective index of the real diamond. 

Similarly, differentiating between what is true and false is based on the line defined by the word of God. The devil is the father of lies. No matter how much he disguises himself, he will not have the complete truth; falsehood still dwells in him. As Christians, we must be familiar with His word and use it to determine what’s true and false. 

1 Pet 5:8  
*Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.*

He is crafting ways and means to make us fall. Are we able to see through his tricks? We must or we’ll fall. 

Rom 13:11-13  
*And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy.*

The armour of light is meant for protection. How do we safeguard ourselves? Besides being vigilant and mindful of our conduct, there’s also the need for us to suit up in this armour of light, that it may protect us from the devil. 

Matt 5:14-16  
*“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.*

We need to be the light of the world through our deeds and actions. When others see our good works? They can glorify our Heaven. 

Does God really need us to draw people to Him? Does He really need us to bring glory to Him? Isn’t He an almighty God, able to draw people to Himself? Isn’t His glory a sufficient attractive factor?

When Moses wanted to see God, he was unable to see it directly because of how glorious God was. Instead he had to be hidden in the cleft of the rock, get covered by God’s hand, and only see His back. 

When we let our light shine before men, this is putting on the armour of light. 

Grooming a person involves allowing them to walk alongside us. It can be frustrating, especially because they are slow and working with them takes up more time (as you have to undo their mistakes). But we give him opportunities to do the work so he’s able to grow his capabilities. This requires patience on our part. 

Although God’s power is so great and he’s able to do everything on His own, He allows us to work with Him so that we may grow. Let us grasp hold of such opportunities to work alongside God. We may not be able to do it so well the first few times, but this is an opportunity to grow. 

What kind of light do we give off? There are many types of lights in this world. But is all light good? There is harmful light too e.g. blue light that emits from phones and computers.

Luke 11:33-35  
*“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light. The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is good, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is bad, your body also is full of darkness. Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.*

Light and darkness. Extremes. Darkness in us reflects badness that might negatively impact others. Nurture ourselves to give forth beneficial, helpful light. So that we don’t just save ourselves, we benefit others too. 

John 3:19-20  
*And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.*

Those who practise evil deeds do not want to draw near to Christ who is light because that would mean exposing their deeds. 

Except for cockroaches and earthworms that shun away from light, all other bugs draw near to light. Why? Many of them like the warmth. It’s also an opportunity to socialise.

Is it true everyone who comes to listen to the gospel truly seek the truth? They may come for other reasons. 

Jude 12  
*These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots*

While we should show care and concern for people, it shouldn’t supersede the truth we preach. When we preach the truth, we will naturally show love and care because that’s what the truth encompasses.

But if we just attract people with love and care, we’ll just attract bugs, who come only for benefits e.g. warmth. 

While we shine for God, let’s shine with wisdom. Let’s be discerning. Let’s know the light is to protect us. It’s not meant to harm people. And it’s supposed to draw people in for the right reason. 

Psa 36:9  
*For with You is the fountain of life;
In Your light we see light.*

What does the fountain of life have to do with light? The light of God is able to give us life. It is only through God are we able to have light. We must also use His light to see light. Is the light we see through the light of God? Or are they other lights - lights of the world?

Do we see light because of Christ? Do we see light in accordance to Christ? If the light we see is in Christ, then there will definitely be life in us.

Let us be mindful of the impact and influence we have on the people around us. Some of us may think: This is my life. I can do whatever I want. It is my freedom. Please don’t take away my freedom. So what if the things I do affect others? It’s of no concern to me. 

But according to the ending Hymn 342 “Let the Lower Lights Be Burning", there is a role and purpose in our lives to be workers of God, participating in the work of saving souls and strengthening the people around us. This is what we have to do. Some people may ask, “God is powerful. Why can’t He do it Himself?” It’s for our own good, so that as we partake in these things, we can grow as a Christian. Put on the armour of light to protect ourselves and to draw people who are true worshippers of God in.
