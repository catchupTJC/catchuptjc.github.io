Summary:  
Pay attention to the development of our youths, because a church without strong/vibrant youths will fade over time. If we realise our children are a heritage from God, both in our households and in church, be clear not to squander it away; it must be nurtured. How?  
1. Bring them up in the training and admonition **of the Lord** + how? (read on!)  
2. Teach our children the word of God **diligently** + how? (read on!)  
3. Bring our children to church; **don't rob them of the opportunity** to build their faith and make spiritual companions in Bible Camps  
4. Even if the youths are not our blood children, are we just an instructor? Or do we have the **heart of a father**? (1 Cor 4:15)

Psa 127:3-5  
*3 Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord,
The fruit of the womb is a reward.
4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
So are the children of one’s youth.
5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them;
They shall not be ashamed,
But shall speak with their enemies in the gate.*

The Bible reminds us our children are a heritage from the Lord. v4 describes our children as arrows in the hand of a warrior. v5 talks about how a man who has a quiver full of these arrows is happy. 

If a person’s quiver is full of these arrows, then v5 tells us he need not be ashamed; he can speak with his enemies in the gate; he need not be afraid of his enemies. 

If we consider this, the children/young in the household, or the young in the kingdom, or the young in the church, are symbols of strength and vitality. They are symbols that the future is bright. If the church is without strong youths, if the church does not have children, moving forward, the church will not have strength and vitality. It’s the same for any kingdom. This is why the Bible describes them as arrows in a quiver. 

1 Sam 2:30-33  
*Therefore the Lord God of Israel says: I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.’ But now the Lord says: Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. And you will see an enemy in My dwelling place, despite all the good which God does for Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever. But any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart. And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age.*

This was the proclamation of God’s judgement on the household of Eli, because Eli’s children were wicked. While Eli was the priest, he did not restrain them. This family was originally meant to be blessed; that had the privilege to serve God as a household of priests. But because they despised the grace of God, such a judgement was proclaimed on them. 

God basically said, “I’ll cut off your arm! There will not be an old man in your house.” In other words, a lot of them will die in their youth. This household will fade into nothingness. This was a curse from God. 

Indeed, we must pay attention to the development of our youths. Because a church without strong and vibrant youths will also fade over time. If our households are without youths/children strong in the faith, over time, the grace of God will no longer be in our household. 

Sadly, we have seen this happening over time. The first generation of faith passed on to the second. Sometimes very rarely passing on to the third. Even less to the fourth. We must come to realise **when we receive the grace of God, why do we let it go so freely?** The grace of God is so precious. Why would that not be the most important thing that we hand down through the generations in our household? The grace of God has been established in a particular place. We can see the church was glorious. But if we don’t pay attention to the development of our children and youths, over time, we will see the church gets weaker and weaker. There might be a building without people. That would truly be very very sad. 

**Our children are a heritage from God. Not just in our household but also in church. And if they are a heritage from God, what do we do with this heritage?** Do we squander off the heritage like a prodigal son? All the good that has been accumulated in previous generations is lost in ours?

The speaker thinks no one wants to have such a name to ourselves - heritage handed down to us is destroyed in our generation. If we realise our children are a heritage from God, both in our households and in our church, we have to be very clear that we must not squander this heritage away. More importantly, we must nurture this heritage we have. So they can grow and hand them off stronger to the next generation. As arrows they need to be sharpened. If they’re not sharp, they’ll never be good enough to take on the enemies. So it’s the responsibility of the parents and church together. The joint accountability to develop our children in the faith. Do we recognise this?

The sermon will cover two aspects:  
1. As parents  
2. Church at large (ministers, preachers, teachers)

## 1. As parents (and grandparents)
**a. Bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord + how?**  
Eph 6:1-4  
*Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with promise: “that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.”
And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.*

There was a young sister who had a friendly argument with her mother, because she didn’t want to follow certain instructions by the mother. 

The mother said to her, “Don’t you know the Bible? Honour your father and mother. So *you* must listen to *me*, not *I* listen to *you*.”

The young sister...ok lorh what to do...just listen. 

Her older brother who was around came by and said, “I teach you one secret method!” He turned to Eph 6:4 *"And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.”*

The little girl’s eyes lit up. Oh ho ho. She went to tell her mother not to provoke her to anger!

Let’s take a step back. What’s key in this passage? If we want our children to automatically obey their parents and honour them, one important thing is to obey parents IN THE Lord (v1). But what the speaker wants to empathise is v4 “bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord”. 

This is the responsibility as parents. As we read the Bible as human beings, we often read the Bible for other people. Just like the little girl. She should be reading “honour your father and mother”, not the other part “do not provoke your children to wrath”. But at the same time parents should read “bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord”. 

The Bible is good for all of us. We ought to humble ourselves and learn what we ought to learn. 

This is our responsibility. If we don’t want to provoke our children to wrath, we must prepare to bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord. 

But if we look at what we do, is that at the top of our heads?

Sometimes when we’re frustrated, we may nag and scold. We must discipline our children. But **in our prayer as we reflect, let’s think how we want to train and admonish them in the word of the Lord.** Because that’s the right thing for us to do as parents. And if we truly do that, then there is a common basis for us to tell them what is right and what is wrong. It’s not just our whims and fancies or the mood we are in that day. It’s what’s right and wrong in the eyes of God. Then their obedience and honour will be completely aligned with the teachings of God. Then their obedience and honour is not just on the account of fear but out of respect. 

As parents, let’s endeavour firstly to bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord. 

How can we bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord?

Deut 6:4-12  
v5 *You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.*  
This is the instructions to the adults who can hear. This is the starting point. All of us adults who can read, hear, understand, must first love the Lord with all our heart, soul and strength. The faith and love of God must start with us. If it doesn’t start with us how are we ever going to bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord?

Our children look up to us. And if we are not people who love the Lord with all our heart, soul and strength, we will not be good examples. 

v6 *And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.*  
Again, it starts with us. Let the word of God dwell richly inside our hearts. 

v7 *You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.*  
First put the words of God in our hearts. Then we use them to train and admonish our children. The speaker would like to emphasise here it’s about teaching them DILIGENTLY. 

The speaker doesn’t know what we are usually diligent with in our lives. In the world, there’s the term called ‘tiger mom’. The speaker won’t comment on whether it’s right or wrong.

**b. Teach our children the word of God diligently + how?**  
The following part is non-negotiable - teaching our children the word of God diligently. **Of the many things we teach our children, let’s not forget this part - teach them the word of God diligently.**

What does it mean to teach them diligently?

If we read v7 *You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.*  
In other words, at all times! Sit down also must talk. Walk also must talk. Lie down also must talk. Rise also must talk. This is what it means to teach the word of God to them DILIGENTLY. At all times. In all places. And also in multiple ways. 

It should be the centre, the pivot of all our conversations. 

Study hard. Why? When the speaker was a kid, his then non-believing parents told him it was so he wouldn’t end up working in this this this job. 

Study hard. Why? For God. 

Work hard. Why? Because God tells you not to be lazy. 

There are many things we must and can teach our children. But we can anchor that on the purpose and word of God. So teach them at all times. At all places. In all circumstances. And in multiple ways. 

Because v8 says *You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.*  
So when they go in they can see, go out also can see. 

This is what parents can do and must do. We may not be there yet. But this is where we can all learn together. Let’s endeavour to bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord. How? Deut 6 gives us a glimpse. 

Exo 10:1-2  
*Now the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, that I may show these signs of Mine before him, and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and your son’s son the mighty things I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am the Lord.”*

These were the words of God to Moses. He wanted the people of Israel to tell of the mighty works He had done in Egypt to their sons and son’s sons. This is very important. **The grace of God that we have experienced in our household must be passed down so the name of God continues to be glorified and the faith in this God continues to be passed down.** The word of God and testimonies and grace cannot be allowed to be diluted. 

Joshua 4:4-6  
*Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’*

The grace and mighty works of God, the promises of God that have been fulfilled! Here, stones are erected so that next time when their children ask about them, they would answer about the mighty works of God that brought them out of a land of slavery to the promised land. 

This has moved not from just an individual family but has become an institutionalised way of passing down the faith. Not just for one family but for an entire nation. From individual to an entire congregation. We have common instructions in the truth we have received to be passed from generation to generation. 

It’s the accountability of both the parents and the church. 

Do we develop our children and youths to understand what the church is really about? The basic teachings of the church and wider understanding. The moral ethics. The grace of God leading the church. 

The church has many initiatives today. The Closerdaybyday Bible Reading schedule. Sharing written on closerdaybyday.org . Facebook page for people to post. Are we part of this church wide initiative? If we are not yet, we can start. Let’s come together as a family to do that. 1 chapter every 2 days for just the weekdays! We can go on Facebook to see what people are writing and learn from that. A time to bring the family together in the word of God. 

Members have been encouraged to set up their family altar. This can be a starting point. During the COVID period, members have been encouraged for the family to come together to pray at 8 or 10pm.

For some RE classes, some teachers have organised Bible Reading over zoom. Thank God children join in. But we need parent support. Not many parents join in. There’s RE homework. Parents can help. That’s how we can fulfil the basic responsibility we have to teach our children; to complement the church initiatives. 

**c. Bring our children to church; don't rob them of the opportunity to build their faith and make spiritual companions in Bible Camps**  
Bring our children to church and make sure they zoom in to RE class. 

Luke 2:41-48  
v41 *His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.*  
Both Joseph and Mary themselves had a life of faith/worship. They went to Jerusalem EVERY YEAR at the Passover. This was their norm. Every year, we have Spiritual Meeting. Is this something as parents we say, “I’ll set aside time and take leave!” 

In the household of Jesus, that was normal. They went there every year. 

v42 *And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.*  
When it’s the right time to do the right thing, we have to do it for our children. As parents, we must diligently bring our children through the RE system. We have a very comprehensive RE system. **Let’s not shortchange our children. Let them go through the full RE.** When it’s time for nursery, let them go for nursery. When it’s time for kindergarten, let them go for kindergarten. All the way until they go through the entire system. There’s also related activities to RE. Encourage and bring them to be fully engaged. **At the end of RE, help and encourage them to transition into the youth group.** This is what we parents can and ought to do. And at relevant parts of their lives, make sure that they are also put through the relevant experiences available for them. 

For example, the church has Bible camps. The P4-P5 camp. New Teens Camp. Bible Seminar. Students Theological Training Course; it’s a 3 year programme. After that there’s the Graduate Theological. Then in tertiary, there’s the tertiary theological. 

The church has a very comprehensive suite of all these programmes to develop our children/youths. Actually this is what can be very unique for a True Jesus Church youth. **If our children go through the entire RE system and above activities, they’ll emerge with a very good grasp and understanding of the word of God. They would have a very strong foundation in their faith!**

The speaker was a convert. By the time he came to church, he only had the opportunity to attend 1 year of the Student Theological. But when he looks back, he wishes he had all those opportunities. As a parent himself, he really wants to make sure his children go through all these things he never had a chance to. He hopes all parents and grandparents will allow your children to go through all these things and have these opportunities.

We make choices. **Tuition, extra enrichment programmes, or church.** It doesn’t mean we cannot send them for tuition and enrichment classes. Oftentimes, we’re actually able to handle both. But **we might unknowingly esteem one more than the other.** Year end Theolo may be a time we go for tour. Now with COVID we cannot travel. But **even if we can travel, there’s just that window our children can go through the Theological. It’s very important in their lives.** Actually we can still choose to go for tour before or after. Or just for those few years don’t go, it’s okay. **Let’s not rob them of this opportunity.** The registration for the year end theolo has just been opened. We really hope parents will encourage your children to attend. 

Besides learning the word of God in theological, they also develop strong spiritual friendships and companions. 

2 Tim 2:22  
Paul encourages Timothy: *“Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace **with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart**.”*

Who do we hope our children have as best of friends? The Bible has many teachings about choosing our friends wisely. Of course that doesn’t mean friends made outside are bad. But not all of them have the same Christian values. So **for the purpose of our faith, even while our children have friends outside, it’s very or even more important for them to develop strong friendships/companionships in the church, in their faith.** 

There’s something else we as parents can do. Support our children in bringing others into the faith. 

Attending theolo is a very good opportunity for our children to develop close friends in the faith. 

## 2. Church at large
Ministers, preachers, teachers should also take this accountability very seriously.

1 Cor 4:14-17  
*14 I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you. 15 For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 16 Therefore I urge you, imitate me. 17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.*

Paul was a good teacher for sure. Knows the word of God and was very eloquent. But that was not the main point. It’s his attitude we need to learn from. He says here in v15 *“For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers”*.

**As we develop our youths and children in church, do we have the heart of a father?** It is very easy to be an instructor. Just talk only lorh. But to be a father takes a lot of commitment and love. It’s not about just saying what we have to say. It’s about making it and ensuring they can understand and receive and be changed and touched by what they hear. It’s beyond an instructor. It’s leading then in the way of the Lord. That’s why when we read on, Paul says to imitate him (v16).

Do we dare say this?

We can talk. But what is our attitude in service, in prayer? What is our character like? 

We hope all these things can inspire the next generation. Of course we can instruct.
But over and above, we need to inspire. Inspiration goes over just a lecture. 

**As workers in the church, let’s be mindful of this. When running the Bible camps and RE classes, are our hearts in there like the heart of a father?**

Gal 4:19  
*My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you*

This is Paul like a mother. To him, the church is like his little children.

Children are a heritage of the Lord. Arrows in our quiver. As parents, as a church, how are we developing them?
