Summary:  
Peter warned us that “the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour”. Why? Because he personally experienced it. Peter fell and denied Jesus not because he lacked faith, but because he was too sure of himself. The devil will target our vulnerable points and capitalise on our weaknesses to bring us down. Today let us take some time to reflect: **What are the weaknesses in my faith?**

Likely, only the disciples John and Peter knew of Peter’s denial because only both of them were in the courtyard. But it was recorded in all 4 gospel books. How did the rest come to know about it? After it happened, perhaps Peter shared what happened with the others. Sharing one’s shameful deeds was something very brave of Peter. This enables us to know of and learn from it as well. 

6 phases:  
1st: Before denial  
2nd: Entering the courtyard  
3rd: 1st denial  
4th: 2nd denial  
5th: 3rd denial  
6th: Rooster crowed and Jesus looked at him

Why did Peter deny Jesus? He was the one who would often answer Jesus’ questions first. Yet he even cursed and swore that he did not know the Lord. If even Peter would do something like this, let us take heed lest we do so as well. 

Luke 22:31  
*And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.*

Peter denied the Lord because he was attacked by the devil who wanted to sift him as wheat. Sifting as wheat means to do so gradually. 

Peter was an apostle with great faith. Despite that, he fell easily because of the devil’s attacks. Let’s not take the devil’s attacks lightly. They are severe. He will strike our vulnerable places. 

The Bible records other people who were attacked by the devil as well. For example, Job. No leeway was given. All Job’s children were killed and all his possessions were lost. The devil can cause great harm. 

Even someone like Peter was vulnerable to the attacks of the devil, what more us?

1 Pet 5:8  
*Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.*

Why did Peter say this? Because he personally experienced it. So he wanted to warn us. 

The devil is always looking for ways and means for us to fall. But we often like to live life on the edge. We tell ourselves, “It’s okay. I won’t cross over the line.” We think we have the self control not to go over the line but we forget there’s someone who is waiting to push us over. 

When faced with the attacks of the devil, we can resist him with a steadfast faith (v9). He may show us many good things but it’s all poison. 

Peter was attacked by the devil. Why? Was it because he lacked faith, since Peter himself explained we must resist the devil using steadfast faith? It likely wasn’t because he didn’t have faith.

Luke 22:32  
*But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”*

This verse shows Peter had faith. Jesus prayed his faith would not fail. This tells us he still believes and loves the Lord. 

Peter was the first one to say he would not forsake the Lord. He wasn’t boasting; he really believed and had the faith at that time. 

Further, he was one of the two disciples who followed Jesus to the court. The rest of the disciples had fled. 

Consider the man who fled naked when young men laid hold of him (Mark 14:51). That’s how scary the situation was last time. Yet Peter followed Jesus in.

Why did he deny Jesus then?

He was too sure of himself. He was so confident that he didn’t put the words of Jesus in his heart. He didn’t give Jesus’ words much thought. What he thought about was the mindset and emotion that he loved the Lord so much. How could he deny the Lord?

Matt 26:40-41  
*Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”*

Jesus told Peter to watch and pray, but Peter fell asleep. He was not watchful. 

All of us say we believe in Jesus. Further, we sin while we believe in Him. Why do we sin then? We are not aware we are being attacked by the devil and treat it lightly. But sin can happen in an instant. If we are not watchful, the lion will swallow us. 

The devil made use of Peter’s weakness to attack him. Peter was not aware of his true level of faith. He seemed to display a great level of faith, but there were lapses. For example, when he wanted to walk on the sea. He did walk on the sea but he started to doubt and sink. This should have been a good reminder to Peter. He thought he was strong in faith but he was not. He should have been more aware of his weaknesses. But Peter committed the same mistake, having a faith based on his own determination and mindset. 

What are the weaknesses in our faith? This gap might become a fatal injury. If we have this issue, we must acknowledge it. If we don’t, we won’t work on it. If we do, we will try to improve it. 

How often do we ponder on our weaknesses in our prayer or quiet time?

Don’t treat our weaknesses as a small thing. It’s something the devil will use to attack us. 

Despite what happened, Peter knew how to repent. Denying the Lord was such a bad thing. But Peter knew how to turn back. 

Luke 22:32  
*But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”*

To what extent did the devil want Peter to fall? To the point he would lose his faith. But Jesus prayed that his faith should not fail. 

After Peter denied Jesus thrice, Jesus looked at Peter and he realised. Peter was devastated by what he did. But the look of the Lord Jesus helped him to keep his faith.

Heb 7:25  
*Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.*

What is Jesus interceding for us on? To save us to the uttermost. 

In the courtyard, Jesus and Peter would have been able to see each other. Why didn’t Jesus look at Peter earlier to warn him before the denials? Why did Jesus only look after the denials, wasn’t that too late?

The same happened for Adam and Eve. Only after they sinned did God come to ask them where they were. 

Why does God allow men to be in a vulnerable position with the devil? We may think if God had come earlier, they wouldn’t have sinned. 

We must realise our faith requires a true and sincere heart to God. This can only be demonstrated when we make the choice ourselves. 

It was up to Peter to make the decision. His decision was the inability to overcome his weaknesses. But thankfully, the Lord Jesus prayed for him. Let’s pray today that as we make decisions in our life of faith, to make the right decisions. Remember Jesus is interceding for us and reminding us. 

Sometimes we don’t take heed of His warnings because we aren’t close to Him. When we are close to someone, we would be able to hear their voice even when we are far away. A mother would be able to recognise her child’s cry in a crowd. 

If we are not near to God today, how do we recognise and hear His voice? That’s why we can’t heed His warnings. 

Remind ourselves the Lord Jesus is continually interceding for us. 

Luke 22:61  
*And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”*

If we were in this situation, would we be like Peter? Would we feel we have let God down? If we do not control ourselves to obey the word of the Lord today, then this scenario happens repeatedly. The Lord turns to look at us. Would we feel deep remorse? Would we feel we have let God down?

Let us tell ourselves that we don’t want to keep being in such a situation. Treat our faith seriously so we can glorify God and edify men.
