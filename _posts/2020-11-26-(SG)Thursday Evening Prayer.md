Summary:  
In a vision, Jesus said to an anxious brother, “Pray. I am here.” Today when we pray, do we think He is not here? Let us pray hard for the Lord to have mercy not to pass us by.

In the Hymn 269: Pass Me Not O Gentle Saviour, there reads the lyrics “While on others thou art calling, do not pass me by”

The speaker tells a testimony of a brother who saw the Lord Jesus appear during the prayer session. He was observing those who were praying. Some members were praying very earnestly. But there were also some members who were not serious in their prayers. For those who were earnest, the brother saw the Lord Jesus walk towards them and lay hands on them. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues. For those who were not praying seriously, the Lord Jesus passed them by. The Lord Jesus turned as if He was departing. The brother, anxious, cried out to the Lord, “There are still many members who have yet to receive the Holy Spirit! How about them?” 

**The Lord Jesus answered, “Pray. I am here.”**

The Lord Jesus likely wants to tell everyone through this vision: Pray, I am here. 
Let us not be discouraged when we pray. Let us not think the Lord is not here. Let us not think the Lord is not answering our prayers and has departed. 

There are some members who ask, “Why have I not yet received the Holy Spirit? Have I not been fasting and praying? Have not many sessions been arranged for the prayer for the Holy Spirit? Why is it so few have received? Has the Lord left us?”

This vision tells us: Pray. I am here. 

He has not left us. He is here looking at how we pray. He is observing how we believe in Him. And how we fear Him. 

We often ask God, “Why?” But don’t ask ourselves, “Why am I like that?”

Let’s not think we don’t need to be serious in our prayers because the Lord is not here. Do we really think the Lord is not here? That’s why we seem to lack strength in our prayers. As if the Lord is not here watching us. 

We have all been children. When our parents are around, we would do our work seriously. But when they aren’t with us, we might still do our work, but not take it seriously. 

Today when we pray, do we think He is not here?

**He tells us, “I am here.”**

Let’s pray for the Lord to have mercy not to pass us by. To ask Him to give us the precious Holy Spirit.
