Summary:  
This exhortation contains testimonies of members receiving the Holy Spirit. One was a brother who had dementia. While he forgot many things, he did not forget God. While many things were forgotten, God did not forget him - he spoke in tongues.

What kind of God is our God?

He is one who will not forget. 

It is us who forget. He will not forget His promise to give us the Holy Spirit. 

Testimony 1:
A brother, who has passed, contracted dementia. He couldn’t even remember if he had slept or not. There was once he didn’t sleep for 3 days, because he couldn’t remember. He passed out after that. The speaker and a few church members went to visit him. The brother forgot who they were but he didn’t forget God. When they kneeled down to pray and the speaker laid hands on him, he spoke in tongues!

God did not forget him. 

Testimony 2:
On the day the speaker’s father passed, his father was at peace. His platelet count was very low. He told his father, “Let’s pray.” His father clasped his hands together to pray, despite being so weak. Thank God he had received the Holy Spirit. Since he had already received the Holy Spirit, the speaker was comforted that he would be in God’s care. 

Lazarus was suffering on earth but when he died, the angels brought him to the bosom of Abraham. Let us not just read this as a story; it is the faithful reminder of God. 

Let us remember God is a faithful and loving God who does not forget. 

“Pray. I am here.”

Even when we are weak, His grace will strengthen and help us.
