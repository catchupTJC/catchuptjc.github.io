Summary:  
The apostles waited for the promise of the Holy Spirit and all prayed with one accord on the Day of Pentecost. They were praying for the Holy Spirit so that they could bear testimony of the Lord Jesus. To testify of the grace that they had received. Do we have this same attitude in prayer? 

Let’s look at the first time the Holy Spirit was poured down.

Acts 2:1

*When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.*

They were all gathered for one purpose. The Lord Jesus did not say when He would pour the Spirit down. According to the promise of the Lord, the Holy Spirit was poured down.

There are two things we can learn from this. 
1. We don't know when the Holy Spirit will be poured down, but He will be poured down.  
2. Attitude of the 120 people

The 120 people were single minded in their prayer. 

When one is waiting for something, it is a test of his faith. It is possible that people may have waited and lost faith. They did not know when the Lord Jesus would pour down His Holy Spirit. But none of them did that. They all had the same heart. They were 120 people gathered together. What would they have been discussing? There wasn't anyone on the pulpit speaking. They were probably in groups together discussing the Holy Spirit. But they were not there to speak about anything. They were there to diligently pray for the Holy Spirit. 

More importantly, they understood the motive behind praying for the Holy Spirit. They were to testify for Jesus. They had this heart that once the Holy Spirit was poured down, they would go forth to testify. They were praying for the Holy Spirit to be poured down to establish God's kingdom. They were not praying only for the guarantee of their inheritance. They were praying also to bear testimony of the Lord Jesus. To testify of the grace that they had received. To receive power. 

Today when we pray for the Holy Spirit, do we have such an idea? Or do we just pray for the Holy Spirit then that's it? 120 received the Holy Spirit. We might think, ‘Why did Jesus treat them so well?’
Their attitude is important. Although the Holy Spirit was promised by God, if we have the same heart as the people, will the Lord not bestow his precious Holy Spirit upon us too?

Let us have this single mindedness, that we have a heart to live our lives to shine for the Lord. The Spirit within us is a Spirit of glory. This Spirit of glory is within us! But have we been able to manifest God's glory? This is something we have to consider.

Do I emulate the Lord Jesus? When we pray for the Holy Spirit, let us have this attitude. This single mindedness in prayer. In one accord. The Holy Spirit will be poured down.
