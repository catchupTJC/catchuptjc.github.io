Summary:  
When praying for the Holy Spirit, we think there’s always the next day, the next Spiritual Meeting. But we don’t realise there may not be the next second. We don’t know when God will require of our souls. For those who have received the Holy Spirit, it is still applicable to consider: if God requires our soul today, what is the point of all our pursuits in this world?

Testimony by Pr Daniel Chin:  
The General Assembly and International Assembly had approved his application to the theological seminary. But just before that, he was given the opportunity to build a hospital up on Genting Highlands. He thought that would enable him to change his car, his house, everything except his wife. He decided not to go for the theological seminary. 

As he had these thoughts as he was driving up Genting Highlands, he lost control of his car and it was about to topple over the edge. He shouted, “Hallelujah!” His car was just about to topple over. This was terrifying. But to him, the next thing was more terrifying. 

Like lightning, a voice said, “Fool! I’m going to require your soul now.” (similar to the parable of the foolish rich man)

Hearing this, his legs trembled and his hair stood. 

Because he didn’t want to attend the theological seminary, God did this to him. 

How is this related to the prayer of the Holy Spirit? We don’t know when God will require of our souls. 

We think there’s always the next day, the next Spiritual Meeting. But we don’t realise there may not be the next second. 

For those who are praying for the Holy Spirit, we may think in our hearts that there will be another chance. But let’s not be a fool. Realise life is from God. You have to thank God you’re alive today. God has given you life as of this moment, which gives you the chance to pray for the Holy Spirit. 

What we may be lacking is the determination to pray for the Holy Spirit. We may be concerned how people look at us when we pray. Why be so concerned? If today God requires your soul, what is this concern compared to that?

Let’s have such an attitude when praying for the Holy Spirit. To be fully focused and determined to pray and receive the Holy Spirit. 

For those who have received the Holy Spirit, it is still applicable to consider: if God requires our soul today, what is the point of all our pursuits in this world?

Have we used our time well during the pandemic? In the last days, Jesus has said these things will happen. Truly, we see it happening. But how many of us realise this and realise what we ought to do? Everyone is still chasing after a more luxurious house and car. The COE prices are unaffected and remain as high! The thing we are most concerned/bothered about is that we can’t have a meal with more than 5 people. 

How many of us have truly learnt that we should use our time to worship God? That’s dependent on our own personal worship of God. 

The Holy Spirit isn’t the driving force; He won’t force us. If we don’t have the desire to pray, the Holy Spirit won’t wake you up and make you pray in tongues. The Holy Spirit will just move and motivate you to pray. 

If we still don’t have the desire to draw near to God during this pandemic, then we are just waiting for something more serious. Maybe that’ll wake us up. But as people with wisdom, let’s be awakened right now. 

May God give us strength.
