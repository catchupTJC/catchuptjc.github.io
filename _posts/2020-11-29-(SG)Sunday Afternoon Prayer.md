Summary:  
Jesus told the disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit. They didn’t know how long they had to wait, but they waited in faith, because they knew the Lord Jesus was faithful and would keep His promise. God will definitely grant the Holy Spirit to those He wills. If we likewise wait patiently, the Holy Spirit will definitely come upon us. 

Acts 1:4-5  
*And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, “which,” He said, “you have heard from Me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”*

When the disciples were told to wait, they didn’t know how long they had to wait. Still, they waited. 

Acts 1:14  
*These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.*

When the disciples waited, they continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, not knowing when the promise of the Holy Spirit would come. 

They just knew because it was commanded by Jesus, it had to be obeyed. They knew the Lord Jesus was faithful; He would keep His promise. 

They wait with patience. They waited with love with one another. 120 people waited in the upper room for 10 days. We have 100 people in church which is a much bigger space. Yet we find going to the toilet troublesome. 

They waited in faith because they trusted in Jesus Christ. 

Psa 62:5-8  
*My soul, wait silently for God alone,
For my expectation is from Him.
He only is my rock and my salvation;
He is my defense;
I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory;
The rock of my strength,
And my refuge, is in God.
Trust in Him at all times, you people;
Pour out your heart before Him;
God is a refuge for us.*

David as a king had many enemies. He had to lead his people in the fear of the Lord. It wasn’t easy but David found strength in the Lord.

David had a band of mighty men around protecting him. Though they were faithful servants who would die for him, David knew only the strength of the Lord could save him. 

“my expectation is from Him”  
“He is my defense; I shall not be moved”

Men will change. Your best friends today may end up being your enemies. Your loving family members can be the ones who go against you. 

But God will never change. He is full of love. He is faithful and keeps all His promises. If we know how to trust in Him and believe all His promises, then our lives will be full of grace and strength; full of hope. 

In times of weakness, He is our defense.  
In times of strength, He is our joy.  
In times of troubles, He is our rock. His peace will always be with us. 

God is our refuge. 

God is omniscient. There’s nothing He doesn’t know or can hide from Him. It’s useless to hide. We should pour out our hearts to Him. 

How do we pray when we pray for the Holy Spirit? How do we pray when we intercede for one another? It’ll result in the mercy of God. Blessed are those who are merciful for they shall receive mercy. When we love one another, God pours His love on us. When we are willing to humble ourselves before one another, God will exalt us. 

Our prayers will always be edifying.

God will definitely grant the Holy Spirit to those He wills. 

A vision was shown to someone in the congregation. She saw a dove flying around. It would land on the head of certain believers and they would speak in tongues. 

If all of us wait patiently, the Holy Spirit will definitely come upon us. 

Our prayers will be heard and we will definitely be edified. 

Isa 40:31  
*But those who wait on the LORD
Shall renew their strength;
They shall mount up with wings like eagles,
They shall run and not be weary,
They shall walk and not faint.*

Those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. Most of the time we are weak. When everything is well, we don’t feel the weakness. But not everything is well all the time. 

The pandemic is really a great challenge. There are things we took for granted. Our strength is tested. But if we wait on the Lord, our strength will be renewed. 

Don’t think about going for holidays once the pandemic is over. For us, think about how to renew our strength to await the Lord Jesus Christ. 

We pray for the mercy of God. We pray for one another. We pray for each other to receive the Holy Spirit. We pray for truthseeking friends that their hearts may be opened. Last and not least, pray for the leaders of the church. They have been having meetings to decide things. We pray that they may have wisdom so the Holy Spirit leads them.
