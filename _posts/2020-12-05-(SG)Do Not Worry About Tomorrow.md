Summary: 
Many things about tomorrow, we don't seem to understand. But we know who holds tomorrow, and we know who holds our hand. 

Speaker’s thoughts on the pre-hymnal:  
This is My Father’s World: On the Sabbath Day, it’s good to remember God has made the entire world and universe. 

Ivory Palaces: Reminds us of the salvation God gave us which wasn’t bought at an easy price. He is king of heaven but came to be born as the carpenter’s son. He came out of the ivory palaces to bring salvation to us. 

God Will Take Care of You: This salvation doesn’t stop just at the point. He continues to take care of us throughout our lives. 

What is our response as believers of God? On the Sabbath Day, it’s good to draw closer and closer to God. The Sabbath Day is a day to remember God’s creation, God’s salvation for us, and for us to gather as a congregation. 

Some of us because of the pandemic may be affected more than others. For some of us, the impact has yet to hit us but down the road it may. We truly long for God’s protection and guidance throughout our lives and the ideal case is for us to lead a worry-free life. 

How will year 2021 be for us? Is it a year filled with worries or hope? In order for us to lead a worry-free life, Jesus taught us this in Matthew 6:31-34;

*31 '“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 
32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 
33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.'*

In this passage, Jesus reminds us to not worry about our lives. He reminds us that the Gentiles seek after physical needs - food, drinks and apparels. Sometimes the Gentiles seek after these things not purely out of necessity but out of wants. Jesus assured us that our Heavenly Father knows what we need as a necessity for survival and He guarantees these needs as survival. He will definitely satisfy our NEEDS but NOT WANTS; we need clothes so that we won’t freeze; we need food to receive energy for survival; we need water for survival. But beyond all these are wants and not needs. 

Jesus promises us that our needs will be added unto us but it’s contingent of whether we seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. The key to a worry-free life is to seek after His righteousness. Then all these needs will be satisfied. 

## 1. Seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness first
Have we really been seeking the kingdom of God and His righteousness first? Are God’s kingdom and principles the foremost in our thoughts? Let us refer to a negative example in Haggai 1:2-6; 

*2 '“Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, saying: ‘This people says, “The time has not come, the time that the Lord ’s house should be built.” ’ ” 
3 Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying, “ 
4 Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, and this temple to lie in ruins?” 
5 Now therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: “Consider your ways! 
6 “You have sown much, and bring in little; You eat, but do not have enough; You drink, but you are not filled with drink; You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; And he who earns wages, Earns wages to put into a bag with holes.”'*

Think about the situation of the Jews during Haggai’s time  - they did not think of God’s kingdom as the most important. Instead, they worried about their own families, houses and situation in their livelihood. This is a negative example of not seeking the kingdom of God first and His righteousness. 

Think about these people at that time and contrast them with king David.  
Turn to 2 Samuel 7:1-2;

*1 'Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies all around, 
2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains.”'*

King David asked prophet Nathan whether he could build for God a temple. Compare David with the Jews during the time of Haggai, what is similar between both groups would be that both experienced living in panelled houses. Granted, David could have lived in a palace which was more majestic but both groups had a solid roof. But the response between those living in both houses is very different. 

The Jews and the people in David’s time were different.  
David was living a time of peace because God had let him rest from his enemies. Whereas the Jews during the time of Haggai were not experiencing a particularly good time. 

We read that Haggai said - “consider your situation”. They were definitely not thriving but it was still not so bad where they couldn’t sustain themselves because they could still live in panelled houses. If they were in a dire state, they would be living in the streets instead of panelled houses. Hence, the Jews were not doing that well but also not that badly even though they were poor; they weren’t also poor to the extent of living to survive. 

On the other hand, David felt that he had to build a house for God — “if I lived under a solid roof, how could God not?” Because of David’s intent to build for God a temple, because he placed God’s kingdom and His righteousness first in his heart, God blessed David such that David’s throne would last forever. 

Whereas for the Jews at the time of Haggai: because they didn’t seek God’s kingdom and righteousness first, we now read of the punishment in Haggai. They tried to get money but their pockets seemed to have holes; they sown a lot but seemed to reap little. This is the difference between the Jews during Haggai’s time and David. 

Perhaps there is also another difference to consider.  
For David, when his idea of building a temple for God came to his mind, there was no blueprint or example in the past he could follow. The piece of land was not ready; there was no land dedicated for temple building; the foundations weren’t laid at all. 

Whereas for the Jews during the time of Haggai, they had a model before (the temple Solomon had built. Some of the survivors would have known of the splendour and majesty. Some of the Jews were also one of the ones who built the foundation of the temple.). 

If you compare David’s situation (knowing nothing at all) to the Jews (who had some idea of how the temple should look like, had already started on the foundation), which would be easier to work with? To have something from scratch or to have to rebuild, which is more effortful? For the speaker, that makes David’s intention to build the temple all the more special - he thought about God and wanted to make something special for Him. This is what it means by speaking God’s kingdom first and His righteousness. David placed God very first in his thoughts. The one who was enjoying the things in his life also thought, “How could I enjoy these good things but the ark of the covenant lies only in the tent?” 

The Jews during the time of Haggai tried to enjoy what they could in their time. At least, they had a panelled roof. But this didn’t make them thankful to God but instead sought for more to grow in their material possessions. 

Who are we more like in our lives?  
Are we more like David or are we more like the people during the time of Haggai? Regardless of our present experiences, whether people would deem our lives as smooth-sailing OR what you deem as a trying time where you’re trying to make ends meet, the message of Haggai to the Jews then is still the same to us today: the present time is for us to rebuild the temple of God. 

If we do not place God’s kingdom and His righteousness first, can we really live a worry-free life? 

## 2. While we’re seeking God’s kingdom and righteousness, we must be prepared for obstructions.
Sometimes when we start, we genuinely want to place God’s kingdom and His righteousness first. But with the passage of time and life experiences (especially when faced with adversities and trials), we may start to forget the original intent to fulfil God’s will first. In fact, if we think a little deeper of the Jews during Haggai’s time, they weren’t always in that state as in Haggai 1. When they first started, what happened was that when Cyrus first released the verdict that the Jews could return to Jerusalem to build the temple for God, the reality is that not many Jews responded to this call. In fact, by that time, many Jews were already scattered throughout the Persian empire and doing fairly well in society. Turn to Ezra 1:5-6; 

*5 'Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, with all whose spirits God had moved, arose to go up and build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem. 
6 And all those who were around them encouraged them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.'*

There were 2 groups:  
1. Those who were moved and really wanted to go back to the temple 
2. Those who weren’t willing to go back but were willing to offer some of their goods so that those who returned had some materials 

It was only for the 42,360 who were moved and willing to return. The others didn’t return and preferred to offer their goods. These 42,360 sought the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Hence, they returned to Jerusalem to help in the rebuilding. 

But when adversaries came upon them, work stopped for 16 years. As mentioned, when they first started, they originally placed God’s kingdom and His righteousness as most important. When opposition comes, sometimes we’re unable to stand and hence give in, and no longer seek God’s kingdom first. 

How did the opposition appear to the Jews?  
Read Ezra 4:1-5;

*1 'Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the descendants of the captivity were building the temple of the Lord God of Israel, 
2 they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers’ houses, and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do; and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.” 
3 But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said to them, “You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God; but we alone will build to the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” 
4 Then the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah. They troubled them in building, 
5 and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.'*

The adversaries appeared and they opposed the people who went back to fulfil God’s kingdom. There were 2 practical ways obstructions came about then:

1. Indirect opposition  
When the enemies said, “Can we build the temple together to worship God?” 
If Zerubbabel and Joshua compromised, it would be troublesome because then it’d be hard to just worship God. This sort of compromise would lead to people giving up on fulfilling God’s principles. 

2. Direct opposition  
This is the people coming by force to harass the builders. The opposition even went to the political powers to try to get the Persian rulers to stop the work. 

The Jews were strong enough to get past the first obstruction. But with continued harassment, they succumbed to the second obstruction. Perhaps in the beginning, the Jews felt that they could continue to rebuild the temple. But when there was a clampdown by the officials, overtime, they also didn’t continue the work. 

Thankfully, God raised prophets. This is why we have Haggai and Zechariah. Because of their rebuke and encouragement, the Jews awoke from their slumber. They had previously sought God’s kingdom and righteousness but overtime their zeal weakened. If we're honest and realise that we’ve stopped putting God’s kingdom and righteousness first, let us also be tender to the warning and encouragement of Haggai: it is time to rebuild the temple of God. 

If at this moment of time, we have not succumbed and are still struggling because we know that God’s kingdom is most important but the obstacles and adversaries are strong, let us hold fast and stand strong so that we truly seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness first. That is how we can not be worried about tomorrow.

If we want to not worry about tomorrow, we must ask ourselves if we’ve truly sought the kingdom of God and His righteousness FIRST. Have we really placed God’s kingdom, the people of God, the welfare and needs of the church first? While we’re doing this, there’ll always be obstacles we’ll need to prepare for. Whether it’s the call for us to compromise in our principles or a direct attack, we must continue to hold fast. If we do so, then we can truly trust in Jesus’ promise to not worry about tomorrow because all these things will be added unto us. All these things can come to us as perhaps in the means of a miracle (but not always). For example, we want to find a job but we also want to keep the Sabbath. With such a condition, will it be harder to find a job? If we seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness first, we believe God will open a way for us. God works through His people to help us with our needs. 🥺

## 3. The means which God adds all these things to us - the church is a means by which God supplies the needs of His people 
God works through miracles but also through the church as a means to dispense His people. Turn to 1 Timothy 5:3-8;

*3 'Honor widows who are really widows.
4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. 
5 Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 
6 But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
7 And these things command, that they may be blameless.
8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.'*

Paul was writing some instructions to Timothy about how the church should treat real widows. Real widows as stated in v5 are those who are truly alone (have no family to depend on yet truly trust in God and continue in supplications night and day). These true widows are ones who seek God’s kingdom and His righteousness but the means by which they receive these things can come through the church. The church, while its primary function is to spread the gospel to save souls, is also an organisation meant to distribute and supply the physical needs of some members so that these members who are truly seeking God’s kingdom and righteousness, while in dire situations, can still survive and continue to pray for the salvation of others. 

What implication does this have on members, that the church is the means by which God supplies the needs to some members? 
1. Offer  
To those who are not doing so badly presently, the call for us to us to continually offer to God through the church. Then, the church can administer the help to these people. In 2 Corinthians 8:13-14;

*13 'For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened; 
14 but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack—that there may be equality. '*

Ultimately, if we have and can help, let us offer. COVID-19 has hit all nations in the world. Some nations have suffered more than others. Perhaps Singapore is less affected (note that it differs for individuals). Some members within Singapore may be more affected than others as well. Those who are less affected should continue to be steadfast to offer to God so that the needs of the saints can be met. 

2. For those who’re in trouble to not feel so ashamed to not seek help from the church 
There’s a difference between having dignity and pride (dignity vs pride). Sometimes we may feel ashamed to let others know that we’re in a bad situation but this shame comes from a place where we’re proud and don’t want others to know of our state. God’s church is a means through which the needs of the saints can be met on. Let us not be too ashamed to seek help and let others know of our situations, especially if we’re going through a difficult time. Give the church the opportunity to manifest both love and faith. When we talk about love, 1 John 3:17 tells us; 

*'But whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?'*

When talking about faith, James tells us in James 2:15-17; 

*15 'If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 
16 and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? 
17 Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.'*

You need to give the church the opportunity to manifest both faith and love. 

At the same time, let us not misunderstand that the church is a welfare organisation (because we’re not) - do not squeeze the church for money for your wants. Especially when we read just now about Paul telling us to treat true widows, there are certain principles which the church will take before dispensing aid. For example, if there are present family members, let the family members fulfil their duty first. This widow must also be a true widow who seeks God’s kingdom and His righteousness first, who spends her time praying to God in supplication day and night, not going around spreading gossip. There are certain principles the church need to apply when dispensing help. 

In summary, to lead a worry-free life: 

1. You must seek God’s kingdom FIRST.  
Put Him as your priority. God and the people in church must be top of your minds. 

2. Remember that while we’re doing (1), there will always be obstructions - prepare for them.  
We must stand firm. If we’ve fallen, let us hear the call of Haggai and Zechariah to rebuild. 

3. The church is one of the ways which God can supply the needs for those who seek God first and His righteousness.  
If we can offer, let us offer right now when we have the worldly goods. For those who really need help, let us not be ashamed to reach out to the church. Read out to the EXCO to let them know your situation.
