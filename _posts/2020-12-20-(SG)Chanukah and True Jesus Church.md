Summary:  
Chanukah is a Jewish festival which commemorates the Jews’ triumph over the pagans who defiled the temple. It is about the (1) rededication of the temple, and (2) rekindling of the lampstand. Today, let us learn from the spirit of Chanukah. Don’t be afraid to fight against evil. Revive the rebuilding of the spiritual house of God. Rekindle the lamps to be kept burning in public view. "*But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.*” (John 3:21)

Chanukah is an 8 day festival which ended yesterday (18 Dec 2020). The significance of Chanukah to the Jewish mind and how it relates to us is useful for our understanding.

Is Chanukah found in the Bible? It’s known as the Festival of Lights. It is found in the Bible. It’s called the Feast of Dedication. 

John 10:22-24  
*Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, “How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”*

How did this festival come about? Why is it called Feast of Dedication (Chanukah means dedication)? 

There’s another festival called the Festival of Purim that wasn’t commanded in the 5 Books of Moses/Torah. It can be found in the book of Esther. Purim celebrated the deliverance of the Jews through Queen Esther. If not they would have been annihilated. Esther 9 tells us the origin of Purim. While not in the Torah, it is endorsed in the Old Testament. 

Chanukah is not recorded in the Old Testament because it happened in the period between the Old and New Testament. In the year 200BC, Judea as a province of the Greek empire was under Syria because the Greek empire was fragmented at that time. 200 years before Jesus Christ, there were 2 rulers. One ruled in the south, Egypt. The other in the north, Syria. Judea was ruled by the Egyptian ruler but was wrestled from him and came under the Syrian ruler. 

Years later in 167BC, on 25th December, the birthday of Zeus, the Greek sun god, the Syrian ruler named Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Epiphanes means the manifestation of God) marched into the holy temple of the true God and erected a status of Zeus on Zeus’ birthday. Next, he sacrificed a pig to Zeus on God’s altar. He then chopped the pig up, boiled it in water and poured the water on the scrolls of the Torah which was sacred to the Jews. The Jews did not worship in the temple anymore because it was defiled. The pagans had overtaken it anyway. 

3 years later in 164BC, a priestly family, the Maccabees, revolted. Even though the Jews were outnumbered by the pagans, they actually managed to overcome the adversaries, regain Jerusalem and the temple! They started to cleanse the temple and lit the lampstand with 7 branches. They were supposed to be lit through the generations. Not any oil could be used to light the lamps. They found holy oil specially consecrated to God that only lasts for 1 day. But legend says it lasted for 8 days (not sure if true because it was a later addition to the story). What happened was that they managed to take over the temple, light the lamps and celebrated for 8 days. They rededicated the temple to God. When they took back the temple, the nearest Mosaic festival was the Feast of the Tabernacles. The Feast of Tabernacles occurred in the 7th month and lasted 8 days where they would need to live in tents. The 8th day was the greatest and most important day. They realised they missed it because they were running around overthrowing the pagans. 

But on the 9th month they managed to recapture Jerusalem and get the temple back. The rededication of the temple hence followed the festival they missed. So they celebrated for 8 days. But over the years right up to the time of Jesus, the dedication Feast of Chanukah became a feast in its own right. Originally, it was a make up for the Feast of Tabernacles. That’s why it’s 8 days. 

During the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus made a very important statement of Himself. After that, during Chanukah, He also made a very important statement of Himself. He used two festivals to talk about Himself, to point out who He was and what He had come to bring to mankind. 

What did Jesus say during the feast of tabernacles?

John 7:2, 37-39  
*2 Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was at hand.*  
*37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.*

On the 8th day of the festival, they would pour a lot of water to signify their dependence on God for rain. That was the beginning of the rainy season in autumn. 

Zech 14:16-17  
*And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. And it shall be that **whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, on them there will be no rain**.*

Tabernacles hence had to do with waiting for rain. On the 8th day, there was special praying for rain. That’s when Jesus stood up to say if anyone thirsts, to come to Him and out of their heart would flow rivers of living water. That’s why the people were so angry with His statement. 

In v40 onwards, the authorities came to question Him. There was division amongst the crowd as to who He was. Some wanted to capture Him but didn’t (v44). The chief priest asked, “Why have you not brought Him?” (v45)

Jesus chose the appropriate time to tell the world He was the source of life. “You pour water and ask for rain. Here am I. I will give you living water that will flow out of your hearts.”

During the festival of dedication, this was what Jesus said.

John 10:25-30  
*Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of Me. But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand. I and My Father are one.”*

Can you imagine what the religious leaders were thinking at that time when Jesus said He and the Father were one?

That’s 2 months after the Feast of Tabernacles. It’s the 9th month. The Jews said, “If you’re the Christ, tell us plainly.” Jesus told them plainly. What does Christ mean? To the Jews it just meant a human who was a descendant of David. But Jesus wanted to impress on them that the Christ wasn’t just a mere human. Otherwise He wouldn’t be able to sit on the throne of David forever. He can’t overcome the enemy death. Jesus said, “I already told you but you don’t believe!” He also said, "People of Israel are the sheep and I'm the shepherd.” By saying this, He already says He’s God because God has said He is the shepherd of Israel who are His sheep.

Then He said plainly v30 "I and My Father are one."

Jesus chose Chanukah to proclaim He’s God!

What does Chanukah commemorate? Triumph over (Antiochus IV) Epiphanes whose name means God manifests. Chanukah celebrates triumph over Zeus - the false god. Now on Chanukah Someone says He’s God! 

These were appropriate times Jesus chose to reveal Himself. Between these two chapters 7 and 10, was a span of 2 months (7th and 9th month). The Bible records what happened between these two months. Twice Jesus said He was the light of the world. 

John 8:12  
*Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”*

Not just light but light of LIFE. 

John 9:5  
*As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.*

Jesus said it twice for emphasis. Over the years right up to the time of Jesus, the Feast of Tabernacles came to be celebrated with the lighting of great lamps. Especially on the last 8th day, there’d be a great celebration. 

Do you know how tall the lampstands were last time? They had to climb a ladder to pour oil on it! The wick of the lamp was made out of the worn out garments of the priest. It wasn’t just a small little string! During the days of the Feast of the Tabernacles, the temple was super bright. And of course Chanukah is also associated with lights, it’s a Festival of Lights, because it’s a second Tabernacle. 

We don’t know when Jesus said He was the light of the world. Both times during Tabernacles, both during Chanukah, one in each feast? John doesn’t make it clear. But it doesn’t matter because both festivals concern light.

What does Chanukah have to do with the True Jesus Church? Since Chanukah is about the rededication of the temple, and as a festival of light, it’s a rekindling of the lampstand, we will explore from these two angles. The angle of the temple and the angle of the lampstand. 

John 2:18-22  
*So the Jews answered and said to Him, “What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”
But He was speaking of the temple of His body. Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.*

This records Jesus cleansing the temple. When He did so, people asked Him by what authority He did these things. Jesus said, “Destroy this temple and in 3 days I’ll raise it up.” The Jews said, “We’re trying to refurbish it. It’s taken 46 years and it’s still not done. You’re going to do it in 3 days?” But Jesus was talking about His body as the temple. After He resurrected then His disciples understood. Jesus used the history of the temple to point to His body. 

Solomon’s temple was destroyed. Zerubbabel built it up again; this was the second temple. During the time of Jesus, it was the extension and refurbishment of the second temple. Jesus said, “Destroy this temple. I’ll raise it up on the 3rd day.” He wanted to drive home the point that physical temples will always be destroyed. But God is going to raise up the ultimate temple that’s indestructible. And God’s ultimate temple is the church! It includes people who will not be destroyed. The physical temple saw 2 destructions. Solomon’s temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586BC. Some 70 years later, Zerubbabel led a contingent to rebuild the second temple. After Jesus spoke those words, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up”, decades later in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the second temple. 

How did the conversation in John 2:18-22 happen? Because Jesus was cleansing the temple (v13-17) Why? Was the temple defiled? Were there any pagans in there?

During the time of the Maccabees, it was the pagans who defiled it. But during the time of Jesus, the temple was being defiled by the Jews themselves. Spiritually, which is worse? This was very much like during the days of Jeremiah. When Jesus said they had made His Father’s house a den of robbers, He was using the words of Jeremiah! (Matt 21:13, Jer 7:11) The Jews were defiling the temple at that time. No wonder God allowed the Babylonians to destroy it. Now they were doing it again; they didn’t learn their lesson. And true enough the Romans destroyed it after that. Jesus knew. So He pointed to Himself as the ultimate restoration. A spiritual and indestructible temple. This was also prophesied by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. During the time of Zerubbabel which was the rebuilding of the second temple. 

Ezra 3:1  
*And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.*

It was the 7th month. The people came back to rebuild the second temple. They kept the feast of tabernacles even before they laid the foundation. 

v6 *From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, although the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid.*

This was the Day of Atonement. But they couldn’t carry it out properly because there was no Holy of Holies to sprinkle the blood. Still, they offered sacrifices and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles which signifies God dwells with men. 

v8 *Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began work and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the Lord.*

This happened a few months later (7th month to the following year 2nd month). 

v10 *When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the ordinance of David king of Israel.*

Before they laid the foundation, they first celebrated the Tabernacles. 

4:1-5  
*Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the descendants of the captivity were building the temple of the LORD God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers’ houses, and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do; and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.” But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said to them, “You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God; but we alone will build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” Then the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah. They troubled them in building, and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.*

4:24  
*Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.*

The rebuilding ceased until there was another king, 15-16 years later. 

How did the work start again?

5:1-2  
*Then the prophet Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophets, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them. So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them, helping them.*

Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them. Their exhortation goes very far; talks about things that go long long after, until the New Testament. The ultimate temple would be built by the Lord Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit moved Haggai and Zechariah to use the rebuilt physical temple to talk about the spiritual temple. Just like what Jesus did. He pointed to the physical temple to talk about the spiritual one. 

Hag 2:5-9  
*According to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit remains among you; do not fear!’
“For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once more (it is a little while) I will shake heaven and earth, the sea and dry land; and I will shake all nations, and they shall come to the Desire of All Nations, and I will fill this temple with glory,’ says the LORD of hosts. ‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,’ says the LORD of hosts. The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than the former,’ says the LORD of hosts. ‘And in this place I will give peace,’ says the LORD of hosts.”*

This shows the global nature of God’s house, which is the church. Its glory will exceed that of the temple. Jesus will bring God’s house to the extent of glory where people of all nations will come into it. 

Hag 2:20-23  
*And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai on the **twenty-fourth day of the month**, saying, “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying:
I will shake heaven and earth.
I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms;
I will destroy the strength of the Gentile kingdoms.
I will overthrow the chariots
And those who ride in them;
The horses and their riders shall come down,
Every one by the sword of his brother.
‘In that day,’ says the LORD of hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel My servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says the LORD, and will make you like a signet ring; for I have chosen you,’ says the LORD of hosts.”*

Zerubabbel is used to point to the Lord Jesus Christ. Haggai wanted to say that ultimately, God would rule over all nations. Christ is the one who would lead it. 

In v20, a date is given. The 24th of the 9th month. v18 states it too “twenty-fourth day of the ninth month". That’s the time the foundation of the temple was laid. Why is this date repeated? It’s interesting because Chanukah begins on that night. Chanukah begins on 25th but the Jews count the days based on the evening of the night before. 

That’s Haggai talking about the global nature of God’s house and the global rule of God. Now we look at what Zechariah says. 

Zech 4:1-9  
*Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. And he said to me, “What do you see?”
So I said, “I am looking, and there is a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the stand seven lamps with seven pipes to the seven lamps. Two olive trees are by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left.” So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?”
Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?”
And I said, “No, my lord.”
So he answered and said to me:
“This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel:
Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’
Says the LORD of hosts.
‘Who are you, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain!
And he shall bring forth the capstone
With shouts of “Grace, grace to it!” ’ ”
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying:
“The hands of Zerubbabel
Have laid the foundation of this temple;
His hands shall also finish it.
Then you will know
That the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.*

Here lies the direct significance to True Jesus Church. After the construction was stopped by the adversaries, after 15-16 years, Zerubbabel was assured by these two prophets that his hand which laid the foundation would complete the temple. The adversaries syncretised (attempt to amalgamate) religion. Through Jesus Christ, the foundation was built during the apostolic era. Similarly, the work was halted by people syncretising religion (mixing Christianity and paganism). Instead of bringing a pig into the temple, paganism was mixed into worship and religious beliefs. Festivals and religious rites that had nothing to do with God and the Christian faith came in. Idols came in too. The work of establishing the church was brought to a halt. The apostolic work was stopped. And then comes the True Jesus Church. We revive the rebuilding of the spiritual house of God. Christ will complete it in our days. Not by might, not by power but by the spirit of the Lord! This is directly speaking to us. 

Zechariah saw the lampstand and olive trees. The olive trees are the witnesses of God to the whole earth. These two witnesses are mentioned in Revelation. 

Rev 11:1-4  
*Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, “Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there. But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months. And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.*

A day will come when God’s spiritual house will be trampled on by Gentiles. What does this have to do with us? Many people believe Antiochus IV Epiphanes was prophesied in Daniel which records the temple of God will be trampled by Gentiles for 42 months. That’s what Chanukah is all about. 

Rev 11:2 says so too. *But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.*

Revelation borrows the same imagery of Daniel. Just as Epiphanes went into the physical temple to defile it. The church will also be defiled by Gentiles in a spiritual manner. 

We now have something to learn from the spirit of Chanukah. Don’t be afraid to fight against evil. Rekindle the lamps to be kept burning in public view. (The Jews had the idea to light a 9 pronged candlestick one by one to be displayed, not inside, but OUTside their houses.)

Today are we afraid to testify of God? Or are we the very ones who defile the temple? Do we dare to tell people who we are? If we don’t even talk to defend the truth, do we even have the moral courage to stand for what is right? Can we keep ourselves pure and unspotted from the world? If we don’t dare to stand up for what’s morally right, talking about our 5 basic doctrines would be far from our minds. 

Rev 11:19  
*Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, noises, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.*

This is after the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of Christ in v15. How will this happen if we’re not courageous? It’s through the blood of the martyrs that the world is conquered. In the end, "the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple”. The ark of the covenant signifies the relationship between God and His people. The temple of God, the church, allows us to see the faithfulness of God who keeps His covenant. We also see the blood that’s sprinkled onto the ark of the covenant. 

Heb 12:22-24  
*But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.*

Conclusion  
John 1:5  
*And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.*

John 3:19-21  
*And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.*

What kind of people are we?
