Summary:  
When the Lord says to ‘behold’, it’s important for us to pay attention.  
1. **Behold, I make all things new:** The day of His coming is really very near. If we remember, let us serve the Lord with gladness and godly fear.   
2. **Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men**: Are we in the world or truly in the tabernacle of God today? Do I truly serve one master in my heart?  
3. **Behold, I am coming quickly!**: Only by keeping and obeying the words of God today will we be able to meet Him peacefully when He comes again.  


## The Seventh “Behold”

Rev 21:5

*Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”*

What did God make new? Read v1-2;

*1 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.*   

*2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.*

John saw the appearance of a new heaven and new earth. The first heaven and earth had passed away. The verse also specifically mentions that there was “no more sea”. Why is the sea specially mentioned? At the beginning of Genesis, it says that “in the beginning God created the heavens and earth, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Then, God used 6 days to create the heavens and the earth. It goes to show that before God’s creation, water already existed. This water refers to the sea. But at the end of the Bible, in Revelation, it tells us that there’s no more sea. The sea in the Bible refers to a source of strength or power. From the world's perspective, this is political power. Spiritually, this is the power of the antichrist. And behind that, is the devil.

Rev 13:1

*Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.*

V2

*the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.*

This dragon is the devil.

V6

*Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.*

This beast represents the power of the antichrist. Because he blasphemes against God, against His name and His church.

V7

*It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.*

We can see that the power of the antichrist was able to overcome the saints. The saints were undergoing this great persecution and tribulation.

V10

*He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.*

You can only endure if you have the faith. And only with patience, are you able to endure and overcome the persecutions of the antichrist. The Lord Jesus tells us, “Only he who endures to the end will be saved.” We need to pray that the Lord adds to our faith so we can do so and overcome the persecutions of the devil. 

V8

*All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.*

This verse shows that everyone in the world will worship this beast. Only those whose names are written in the book of life - these people will not worship this beast. If you don’t worship this beast then you’ll be captured and killed. Just like the king of Babylon who made a golden image and asked everyone to kneel and worship it. Whoever did not worship it would be thrown into the fire. We have heard this story since we were young. But when we are faced with such a persecution, will we kneel and worship for our safety and our life? 

Many believers are unable to face this trial and so they kneel and worship this beast. But the true worshippers of the Lord will not give in. Do not be afraid of he who can only kill your body but not your soul. Even if we’re not persecuted, we still have to die one day. If you count the cost, if you give in to persecution and you save your life but your soul perishes, is it really worth it? 

The beast controls the world, and everyone else worships the beast. The world is full of sin. Sin has reached the ‘optimal point’ and judgement is to be meted out. People hope for a better tomorrow but how can the world brimming with sin get better? The 7 seals of God are getting opened up gradually. The red, black and grey horses have appeared. How frightening the grey horse is. 

Rev 6:7-8

*7 When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see.”*  

*8 So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.*

The rider of the pale horse is Death. He will kill with the sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.

Pestilence is a very severe virus that can kill many people. November 2002 was the start of SARS and the pandemic then caused a lot of panic in society. But it went past very quickly in 10 months. Globally, there were 10,000 people who contracted it. And out of these, 744 died. 

Covid-19 is even more frightening. As of 11 Dec 2020, 69 million people have contracted it and 1.5 million people have died. When will this pandemic end? And when will be the next pandemic? We see all these pestilences showing up globally. 

This should cause us to conclude that the day of His coming is really very near. Therefore we have to listen and obey the words of the Lord. We must resolve to come out from the great Babylon. Where should we go then? To enter the holy city, the new Jerusalem. Because God has already made all things new. In the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, there is no more sea. There will not be any more fearful waves that roar. There will not be any sins that fill to its brim. All will be full of peace and tranquility.

Heb 12:22, 27-29

*22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels,*

*27 Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.*

*28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.*   

*29 For our God is a consuming fire.*

In those times, everyone saw the church as weak. Because they saw that the faith of the believers had grown cold. Those who held on to their faith were weak. More of them had left the faith and denounced the faith. Yet, the author of Hebrews saw that their church was the city of the eternal God, the heavenly Jerusalem. It cannot be shaken. Because he saw that the Spirit of the Lord still abided with the church. He saw that the church continued to preach the truth of God. And so he knows that this is the church of God. And when the earth will be shaken and destroyed eventually, the church of God will be lifted up to be the true Heavenly Jerusalem, the Holy City of the eternal God. Therefore the author reminds us that since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, the church of the eternal God, we need to have a heart of thanksgiving. But giving thanks alone is insufficient. 

Serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. Many people forget God is also a consuming fire. How many have already forgotten God is going to come again to judge the world? If we remember, serve the Lord with gladness and godly fear. 


## The Eighth “Behold”

Rev 21:3

*And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.*

The new Jerusalem is none other than the tabernacle of God, which is the true church of God. The reason why God established his tabernacle amongst men is because he wants to live among men. The church has the important commission to preach the gospel. So others can be the children of God and He can be a Father to them. This is an amazing grace. 

God wants to become our father and God loves and dwells among us. The question is whether man is willing to live in the tabernacle of God. Jesus said, “I am willing to gather you as a mother hen gathers her chicks.” Are we willing to obey the words of God to come and gather in this church of God? One thing we should remember - It is our choice whether we are willing or not. But the difference in outcome is like the distance between the heavens and the earth. You say that you are willing to live in the tabernacle of God. But there are so many churches in the world. Which is the true tabernacle of God?

1 Jn 3:24

*Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.*

1 Jn 4:13

*By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.*

John tells us that in order to know whether this is the church of God, there are two important considerations.

1. Does it keep the commandments of God?

This doesn’t mean keeping the commandments partially, but to keep all His commandments in full. Just like the apostolic church who kept the full commandments of God and preached the full gospel of salvation. Does the church that you are in now teach the same as that of the apostolic church?

2. Is there the abidance of the Holy Spirit of God?

This is not the usual working or moving of the Holy Spirit. We can see the works of the Holy Spirit and the moving of God even in other churches. How they submit to God and complete the work which God wants them to do. But this doesn’t mean that they have received the Holy Spirit of God and that they are children of the Lord. This Holy Spirit refers to the promised Holy Spirit of the Lord. And this is the Spirit of the Son. And this is the Holy Spirit that they received on the day of Pentecost, evidenced by tongue speaking. But it is a pity that not every one who claims to obey the word of the Lord will pray for the Holy Spirit. We know that we abide in him because he has given us the Holy Spirit.

Therefore the true church has the abidance of the Holy Spirit and keeps the commandments in full. 

Rev 21:4-5

*4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”*

*5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”*

Who in this earth has never shed a tear? In the Psalms, a Psalmist described the world as a valley of tears. This world causes us to shed tears. Even when we are full of joy and are happy, we cannot divorce ourselves from tears. We shed tears of joy. Even though we are joyful, there is this element of sadness. We are joyful because we have attained whatever we have worked so hard for. But what’s the price we paid to attain all those things? We saw the joy when attaining success but do we see the pain and tears while toiling to attain? 

Even if we have not seen, there is the saying that joy begets sorrow.

But in this new Jerusalem there is true joy. Because God wipes away our every tear. No more sorrow, crying, pain. All these have passed away. So God says, these are written for these things are true and faithful.

Do we truly believe? Then let us examine ourselves and reflect. When the old heavens and earth pass away, will we have a part in the new heavens and earth? This old heavens and earth will definitely pass away, but we may not necessarily have a part in the new heavens and earth. Are we in the world or in the tabernacle of God today?

Yes, some may appear to be in the church of God, but in reality they are in the world.

Do I truly serve one master in my heart? Am I pursuing things that will pass away or those that will last for eternity? 

## The Ninth and The Tenth “Behold”

Rev 22:7

*“Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”*

Rev 22:12

*“And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work.*

The ninth and tenth “Behold” is the same - that is, “I am coming quickly”. But the emphasis is different. In the ninth behold it says,

*Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”*

Have we kept the prophecy of this book? One of the important aspects is mentioned in v18 and v19,

*18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, *  

*19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.*

Isn’t this serious? Originally, his name is written in the book of life, but after that because he adds to the word, his name is taken out from the book of life.

Why is it so serious to add? We add because we don’t think the word of God is perfect and so we add to it to make it better. When we add, we lift men to be of equal status as God. We treat our word as the word of God and want others to follow as we say. God will rebuke such a person. 

We subtract because we think the word of God is no good and troublesome. Doing so is bringing God down to the level of men. It is as if God has flaws in His thinking, so we need to correct it to be more perfect. 

When you add or subtract to the word of God, we show large amounts of disrespect to God. Such a person’s portion will be taken away from the book of Life. 

Prov 30:5-6

*5 Every word of God is pure;*  

*He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.*

*6 Do not add to His words,*  

*Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.*

Proverbs also tell us how severe this is. If you add to his word of God, He rebukes you and you shall be found a liar. Every word of God is pure. The psalmist says that the word of God is refined like pure gold seven times in the fiery furnace. It is flawless and there is no need to add or subtract. If you add or subtract to the word of God, you are a liar. Because you think that the word of God is imperfect. And you think you have the authority to change the word of God, to the extent that there is no need to keep the full word of God. Because you can choose what you like and take away what you dislike. 

This is the attitude of many Christians towards the word of God today. We listen to what we want to listen to. Love. Grace. But we don’t like to listen to things like repentance, asking for forgiveness. 

Are we selecting which part of the word of God we want to listen to? Maybe we don’t add or subtract but we put some aside? What will this be before the Lord?

Revelation tells us. Behold I am coming quickly.

The tenth “Behold” says, 

*My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work*

What’s the main point of the 10th behold? (v12)   

It’s a joyful thing when the Lord comes to bring us back to Him. But we must know the day of His coming is also a day of judgement. Not only to judge those who disbelieve but also those who believe according to His works. If we don’t believe God will come again and mete out His judgement, we won’t do anything. But if we do believe, we will be driven to repentance. Only by keeping and obeying the words of God today will we be able to meet Him peacefully.
