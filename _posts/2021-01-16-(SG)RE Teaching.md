Summary:  
Teachers are subject to stricter judgement. Being subject to a stricter judgement means to be strict with ourselves, even before being strict with the children. 3 Biblical points that RE teachers should demand of themselves:  
1. We need to be properly taught  
2. We need to be like Jesus - be exemplary in humility and service; love them as our own children 
3. Don't be their limiting factor - push them, pull them, encourage them to go along with us to reach the standard of Christ together

Even after baptism, you are still a truthseeker. You should continue to seek to understand the word of God better even after you are baptised. Religious Education teachers must be constantly learning before we’re able to perform our responsibility to communicate the word of truth to the students.

“Being Exemplary RE Teachers” was the suggested title for this sermon. Last week’s sermon’s suggested title was “Being Exemplary Parents” but was changed to “Biblical Christian Parenting” so this sermon’s title was changed to “RE Teaching” to serve as a follow-up to last week’s sermon.

The content of the sermon remained the same but the perspective is now different. Instead of focusing on being an example to others, we focus on how God sees us; what kind of example God wants us to be. 

There is a Chinese saying: Food without education is the fault of the father. 

As long as teachers are concerned, if food without education is the fault of the father, then lack of strictness is the sloth of the teacher. But the word of God goes one step further. What does it have to say to Religious Education teachers?

Jas 3:1  
*My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.*

Teachers are subject to stricter judgement. It’s the same for religious education teachers as you’re teaching young children the word of God. Being subject to a stricter judgement means to be strict with ourselves, even before being strict with the children. 

# 3 Biblical points that RE teachers should demand of themselves. 

## 1. We need to be properly taught 
Isa 50:4   
*“The Lord GOD has given Me  
The tongue of the learned,  
That I should know how to speak  
A word in season to him who is weary.  
He awakens Me morning by morning,  
He awakens My ear  
To hear as the learned.”*

The Lord God has given us the tongue of the learned so we can speak as someone who is properly trained. But how does the tongue of a learned come about? It comes from hearing as someone who’s learned (last phrase of v4). His ear is trained to listen. In order for a tongue to speak as a learned tongue, the ear must listen as a learned ear. 

Do we remember the time Jesus was 12 years old and was in the temple? His parents realised He was missing and went back to find Him in the temple. What was He doing? They saw Him listening intently to the teachers. They saw Him asking questions. They saw that the people around Him were so amazed and asking whose child He was, because the way He spoke and asked questions was so filled with understanding. Jesus listened intently - the ear of the learned. He asked questions; He asked the right questions. He had the tongue of the learned as the people around Him were amazed at His questions. 

If we as RE teachers have students like that, it'd be a dream. But let’s not only desire to have dream students. We better be a dream teacher first. We must first learn to be students. Have the ear of the learned then we can have the tongue of the learned. 

Isaiah 50:4 mentions “He awakens Me morning by morning,”. This reveals it’s a constant, everyday thing. This also shows that it’s done in the morning, the first thing in the day. When we wake up, the first thing we do in the morning should be to pray or read the Bible.

Do we as RE teachers read the Bible everyday? As we ask the students to follow the closerdaybyday schedule, do we ourselves follow it? Even if we don’t follow it, it’s okay, but we must still read the Bible everyday. Even if we are not RE teachers, as Christians we need to feed ourselves with the word of God everyday, what more as RE teachers!

The tongue of the learned comes from the awakening of the learned ear every morning. 

Do we study the Bible? Reading the Bible devotionally is one thing but studying to understand the Bible deeper is another. If you have to teach a certain topic, you’d have to prepare for it. You look up all the verses related to the topic. If you have to teach a chapter, we have to study it. The point is: do we study the Bible for our own sake or only when we have to prepare lessons?

Isaiah tells us we ourselves have to be students of God’s Word first before we can be teachers. We need to read the Bible everyday and study it for our own sake. Only then can we be properly taught by the Holy Spirit. 

You don’t want to go to a doctor that’s not properly trained. You don’t want to board a bus where the driver is not properly trained. By faith, Christian parents send their children to us as teachers. We teach them that they need to row their boats to sail to their heavenly homes but will our own boats rock and sink?

John 3 raises two teachers that called each other a teacher. One of them is called Jesus. The other is called Nicodemus. Nicodemus told Jesus He was a teacher from God, in a very friendly way (v2). Jesus called Nicodemus a teacher too, but in a not very friendly way (v10). 
These two teachers met each other. One was very friendly while the other was not so. What if we were to meet teacher Jesus today. What would He say to us?

They both called each other teachers but with a different indication. We have been appointed to be teachers in the church. We are to teach the children of God. The speaker hopes we have been fulfilling our responsibilities such that others don’t just see that we are sent by the church, but rather sent by God. It’ll be very sad if parents or even students themselves doubt our understanding of God’s word. “Are you a teacher and you don’t know?” That’s what Jesus said to Nicodemus. 

We need to be properly trained. We need to study the word of God for our own sake. 

2 Tim 2:2  
*And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.*

Take note of the phrase “able to teach others also”. The ability to teach others is mentioned twice in this chapter (in v2 and v24). Being able to teach is a very important thing in the Christian church. Even though James says let there not be many teachers. But over here Paul tells Timothy that we need teachers. How to reconcile? It’s just that teachers need to be strict themselves first. So whether you’re a teacher or sermon speaker, you have to be very strict with yourselves, because we teach the word of God. Teaching ministry in the church is very important. That’s why “able to teach” is mentioned twice. 

But the ability to teach is absolutely linked to being properly taught. 

Verse 2 is talking about the passing down of this teaching ability. Paul is very concerned about continuity. Paul to Timothy and then others as well. Now Timothy had to teach others. Not just any person, but those who are able to teach yet others. Paul was talking about the teaching ministry. Teach those able to teach. Teach the teachers. 

Not physical continuity that we must always have teachers. But in the quality of the teaching. The teaching must be pure and consistent. 

Verse 2 also says “What you heard from me (Paul)”. Timothy had to teach others exactly what Paul had taught him. And he had to teach it to faithful men so they don’t change it. And they must be able to really teach, not just tell stories. 

The Singapore Coordination Board provides training for those who have been selected to be teachers. Training is also given to existing teachers in the form of refresher and enrichment courses. The speaker firmly believes there’s always new things to learn, and refreshing what we have learnt before is useful because we forget. 

As a teacher, we must always have the desire to learn and upgrade ourselves. May Singapore RE teachers see the importance of continually learning. Enrich your knowledge. Share ideas. Integrate what you newly learnt with what you knew in the past, then your teaching will be more enriched. 

Chinese saying; Live until old, learn until old. 

Matt 13:52   
*Then He said to them, “Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”*

A scribe of the heavenly kingdom has a treasury and is able to bring out old and new. Mesh the old and new knowledge together and this can benefit the people we teach. 

Jesus uses the word ‘scribe’, which means a learner or scholar. Someone who is knowledgeable and consulted; i.e. he teaches. As RE teachers, don’t miss available courses that you’re able to attend. More importantly, as a scribe of the kingdom, you must be continually self learning. There’s a lot of books in the library and internet resources from our own True Jesus Church websites. 

## 2. We need to be like Jesus - the model teacher 
Not only do we have to demand of ourselves to be properly taught, we also have to demand of ourselves to be like Jesus who is our model teacher. 

John 13:13-17  
*You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.*

Jesus accepts the fact that He is a teacher. But He emphasises to His disciples, “If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet”. He emphasises that what He does is an example to them. A teacher is not only who only talks or directs. You say something? You must exemplify what you say. Because actions speak louder than words. A teacher doesn’t just use his finger to point, he should use his hands to serve. And that was what Jesus was. 
 
In the Bible, there’s two words that are translated to ‘doctrine’ or ‘teaching’. 

John 18:19  
*The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His **doctrine**.*

Acts 2:42  
*And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ **doctrine** and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.*

This word doctrine in these verses means ‘teaching’. It’s related to the verb ‘teach’. It focuses on the content of what’s being taught. We look at another word for doctrine. 

2 Tim 3:10  
*But you have carefully followed my **doctrine**, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,*

Earlier it was derived from the word ‘teach’ which focuses on the content. This word for doctrine is derived from the word ‘teacher’, i.e. the focus is on the actions of the teacher. The content of what you say is important, but who you are as a teacher is even more important. Because Jesus said that whatever the Pharisees say (content), do, because it’s from the Bible. But He says not to follow their example (as teachers). 

Do we ever tell our students, “do you know who you have learned from”? If you’re a good teacher, sometimes you may have to say that. But if you’re not, never say that. 

Titus 2:1  
*But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound **doctrine**:*

This “doctrine” also has to do with the teacher. It’s content but it’s linked to the teacher. That content is seen in the behaviour of the teacher. That’s why verse 7 says “in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works”. You speak things that are proper for sound doctrine but you must do things that are a pattern of good works. 

Jesus is our example in humility and also in service. 

1 Tim 5:17  
*Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and **doctrine**.*

The word doctrine here focuses on the teacher again. Take note of the phrase “rule well”. As a teacher, we must be like Jesus, humble and serving. But you must also be able to rule well. People must respect you also. You must be able to exact firmness. On one hand, Jesus was so nice to the Samaritan woman and many people, but He was very firm with Nicodemus. “You don’t know? You think you can enter the Kingdom of God? You can’t unless you’re born again.” We have to be firm. Being firm and strict doesn’t mean not being humble. 

An elder doesn’t derive authority because people fear him or because his face is fierce. But because he teaches and exemplifies the word of God well. This makes him worthy of double honour. 

James says a teacher is subject to stricter judgement. But here, Paul says double honour. So it’s on both sides - subject to stricter judgement but will receive double honour.

We need to be strict towards our students. 

1 Cor 4:15  
*For though you might have ten thousand **instructors** in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.*

Paul uses another word for teacher - ‘instructor’. The Greek word “paidagōgous”, which is also related to the word Pedagogy. What the root word means is actually “leader of boys”. What comes to mind are those kungfu masters who train the young boys strictly. Paul said there are many ‘kungfu masters’ (i.e. instructors) but few fathers. Paul said he was like a father to the Corinthians. 

1 Cor 4:17, 21  
*For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.  
What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?*

He said he was their instructor but also their father. As their father, he had authority over them. But what he really means is that he’s a loving father. As RE teachers, we must look at ourselves as loving parents to our charges. Our authority over them is because of our loving imparting of the word of God to them; our loving nurturing of them as our children in the Word of God. 

## 3. Don't be their limiting factor
Luke 6:39-40  
*And He spoke a parable to them: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch? A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher.*

Verse 40 means a lot to the speaker, as someone who communicates the word of God to students. Here says that the teacher is the highest limit a student can ever go. The speaker never fails to tell students - “I’m not your teacher, don’t take me as your teacher”, because he does not want to commit the sin of being their limiting factor. The speaker believes that it is definitely possible for his students to become better than him! He does not want to be their limit. 

Of course, over here, Jesus’ intent was to tell teachers to be better than their students. Because if teachers are blind, they’d lead other blind people, i.e. the students, into the ditch. But the speaker builds on verse 40 to tell his students - you must be better than me! How to be better than the speaker? Don’t take him as your teacher! Because the most you can be, would be to become as good as the speaker, but then this is not good enough.

1 John 2:20, 27  
*But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.  
But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.*

“Anointing” refers to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is our teacher! Because the HS is our teacher, we do not need anyone to teach us anything. Jesus Christ says the same thing - call no one on the earth your teacher! All Christians, we have only one teacher, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has ascended, but the Holy Spirit is here. So the Holy Spirit is our teacher and  this is the same as Jesus Christ being our teacher. So as RE teachers, we are their facilitators who facilitate their learning, like an intermediary guide. 

1 Cor 11:1  
*Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.*

Paul tells the Corinth church to imitate him as he imitate Christ - not just ‘imitate me’, but ‘imitate me as I imitate Christ’. Our job as teachers is to give the students a nearer goal, i.e. our students may look to the standard of Christ and feel like… Christ is so high, so far away, how can I ever attain it? I cannot reach the goal. So our job as teachers is to tell our students, “don’t worry, you can make it! Come! Look at me, see how I do it!”. We give them a nearer goal, but don’t make ourselves the final goal! We still have to ask them to look beyond us, to look at Christ. We ourselves have to keep progressing too. If we don’t move forward, they will always remain there. Our standards cannot be too low either. Otherwise we would give them the wrong concept, an inaccurate picture of the ideal Christian God wants them to be. 

So if you’re a teacher, you must work hard. If you’re not strict with them, it’s your sloth. RE teachers must demand high standards of behaviour from their students. Reverence, good attitude in class, attentiveness, punctuality. For example, at the very least, turning on the camera in zoom class. We may think that we are being kind, personable, friendly, but we are spoiling them if we are not strict. It takes our effort. You must bear with the pain of being strict with them. Reprimanding them is not easy - it is never easy. Everyone wants to be nice and avoid scolding, but this is laziness! It is always easier to be the nice guy. But we must maintain standards. The standard of the whole class cannot be affected by one person. This is what we need to do as teachers.  

Be properly taught. Be exemplary in humility and service. Love them as your own children. As a teacher, we have to pray for them everyday; mentioning their names and their needs (but as teachers do we even know the needs of our students?). Last but not least, don’t be their limiting factor - push and pull them, encourage them to go along with you to reach the standard of Christ. 

[closing hymn: 327]

Our responsibility goes well beyond the classroom. Seek every opportunity to meet up with our students. Attend every service. Reach out to them. Initiate conversations with them. Get to know their families, their needs, what they think, what’s inside them. Then you will know how to pray for them. They must be constantly on your mind. Let’s pray to the God who always has us constantly on His mind. We pray that He makes us worthy of the responsibility given to us as teachers.
