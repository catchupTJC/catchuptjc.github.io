59: Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer

The book of Joshua records the history of the Israelites conquering the land of Canaan. This history also describes the journey of their faith. Their journey of faith into the land of Canaan can be referred to to guide our journey of faith to heaven. 

What kind of journey is it?

## 1. A journey we have to fight
Joshua 11:16-19  
*So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.*

Joshua 13:1, 7  
*Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to possess.  
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.*


The Israelites believed the land of Canaan was promised to them. They understood this promised land was received without doing anything, as they were enemies who opposed them. If they were unable to be victorious over their enemies, they wouldn’t be able to receive the beautiful land of Canaan.

**1) Battling for our own salvation**

Today we believe the heavenly kingdom is promised to those who believe in the Lord. We understand the Kingdom of Heaven isn’t something we can receive without doing anything. This is because there are enemies to oppose us and sin to tempt us. If we are unable to be victorious over our enemies and the temptations of sin, then we will be unable to receive the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus hence says, “Those who believe in Me will have eternal life.” He also said to the churches in Revelation, “Those who are victorious will receive the crown of life and sit on the throne with the Lord.”

Not only do we have to believe in the Lord, we have to rely on Him to overcome all kinds of wickedness too. Our life of faith is a journey where we must battle. Not only are we battling for the Lord, we battle for our salvation too. 

The conquest of Canaan can be divided into two phases. 

Chapter 11 records that it took about 7 years to conquer the land of Canaan. In chapter 13, it says Joshua was old already but there were still many enemies to conquer. Since he was already old, God instructed Joshua to divide the land first among the 9.5 tribes. Each tribe would have to overcome the enemies in the land they were allocated to. 

Our journey of faith can be divided into two phases too. Before believing in the Lord, we face all kinds of challenges. After many battles and struggles, we decide to be baptised in the name of the Lord and receive the grace of the Lord and His peace. 

But after believing in the Lord, we face another set of challenges. We need to battle for our own spiritual cultivation. Paul says that the spirit wars against the flesh. We have to submit to the spirit and overcome the flesh. He tells us that he pummels his body into submission, lest he preach the gospel to others and be disqualified. After believing in the Lord, our lives become a test and a battle. Are we able to keep the commandments of the Lord? Are we able to spiritually cultivate ourselves?

**2) Battling for the Gospel**

Another battle we face is preaching the gospel. The commission of preaching the gospel wasn’t just given to the apostles but to all who believe in the Lord. 

There’s still many lands to be conquered today. We still have many friends and relatives who have yet to receive the gospel. Let’s not be satisfied that some have already believed. God says, there remains very much land yet to conquer. 


Although we may have put in much effort into our spiritual cultivation, let us not be satisfied because in God’s eyes, there are still more areas to improve. Although we may have put in much effort to bring our relatives and friends to believe, yet God tells us that there are many who still have not received the Gospel. There are still many to be saved. Let’s seek the help of God to help us conquer more lands. 

## 2. A journey of faith 
Joshua 6:1-5  
*Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in. And the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor. You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.”*

The city of Jericho was their first obstacle. It had very strong walls. It was described as a fortress that couldn’t be overcome. All they had to do was to shut up the city gates securely and no one would be able to take it. How were they to battle it? God commanded them to march around it once for 6 days and 7 times on the 7th day. Then they were to blow the trumpet and shout and the walls would come down. 

By faith, the Israelites circled the city of Jericho and indeed, the walls fell. This was their journey of faith which teaches us how our faith should be like. 

**1) Faith is to follow the commands of God completely**
Circling the city as a battle strategy is illogical to man. But someone who fears God will believe God will bring to pass whatever He says. They need not question His instructions. Even though the instructions are unbelievable to men, they followed. Why?

40 years ago, the Red Sea had obstructed their path but God opened a way for them. A few days ago, the river Jordan obstructed them but God once again opened a way for them. Now the city of Jericho was obstructing their path. But they knew that as long as they heeded the instructions of God, God would help them clear the way. 

Faith is to obey the instructions of God. If we hear and do not act out, or have lots of questions and doubts upon hearing, this isn’t a reflection of true faith and it is not pleasing to God. If it’s so easy for us to trust the words of our friends and teachers, why is it so hard for us to trust the words of God? Sometimes we believe in people much more easily than we believe in God. Often, we doubt God’s words but easily believe the words of men. 

Let us reflect on our faith: Do we truly believe God is omnipotent and omniscient? Are we able to follow the commandments of God as it is?

**2. Faith is keeping the commandments of God fully**
Some commandments of God are easier to carry out while some are harder. If they are hard, would we still be willing to keep them?

Joshua 6:10-11  
*But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.” So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.*

Not only did God instruct them to circle the city, He also commanded that they should not make any noise or speak a word. Day after day, they had to circle silently. This was something mundane and boring. If we think about it, making a sound would not impact their circling. Why not chat while circling the city? If they chat or sung songs, wouldn’t it be better and less boring?

Yet, why did God instruct them not to make any sound? His purpose was to teach them how to fully obey God. While the act of circling the city silently itself was something simple, it was still difficult to bear and carry out, as they might be mocked by the enemies for their method. It may be bearable to be laughed at on the first day. But if they’re laughed at the next and the next and the next day, would they have been able to take it?

Just like when we preach the gospel or go tracting. The act itself is something simple, but why are many unwilling to do so? Because in the process, we may be mocked or scolded, and not many fruits may be borne. While tracts are given out every evangelistic service, we may see no results, and so some have given up. Would we continue tracting?

But the Israelites persisted in obeying the commandment of God, because they believed that the thoughts of God are higher than the thoughts of man. Although going around the city caused them to be mocked, this was still the command of God! The thoughts and plans of God can never go wrong. As long as we keep His commands, we will surely be correct. They didn’t rely on their own thoughts or logic - they simply obeyed. All they needed to do was simply keep the instructions of God. 

Today, do we keep the commands of Jesus fully? Or do we have doubts? We have all along believed that foot-washing is necessary to have a part with the Lord. But today some people question whether foot-washing is really necessary. Others question if baptism needs to be in living water. Some people agree that baptism should involve full immersion but question if it needs to be head bowed. When we have many questions, man ends up coming up with many explanations. After interpreting according to their own thoughts, they conclude it’s not necessary and don’t follow the commands of God. But have not these things already been clearly instructed by the Lord? Why do we not keep whatever He has instructed us to do?

We ought to keep whatever the Lord Jesus instructs is with a simple and pure faith. True faith is to keep the commands of the Lord fully. True faith is not bothered by the mockery of others. True faith is not affected by one’s own thinking. Such a faith will surely be victorious. 

**3. Faith is to be patient and keep the words of God**
Joshua 6:12-14  
*Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually. And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.*

For six days they did the same thing to go round the city. For six days, similarly, nothing happened. Not a single brick fell from the wall of Jericho. But they persevered to keep the word of God. They didn’t change their actions and didn’t doubt. They persisted in their keeping of the word of God. Actually, God could’ve caused the walls to fall on the first day instead of the seventh day. But if that was the case, the Israelites would not have the chance to have faith in God and persevere to the end.

After persevering for a long time and we see nothing happening, are we still able to persevere? We realise there are many areas of faith we still need to work on. God extended the duration to the seventh day before he let the walls fall. So that they can’t go through the process of strengthening their faith and persevering to the end. Under the mockery of others and a seemingly unchanging situation, they didn’t give up. Such a training in faith was very important for the challenges they would face in the future. All the more for us. 

Isa 28:16  
*therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: ‘Whoever believes will not be in haste.’*

This precious cornerstone is the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is our foundation and reliance. 

“Whoever believes will not act hastily”
When accidents happen, we tend to act hastily. But doing so won’t solve problems. Problems can only be solved when we calm ourselves down and rely on God. All of us believe in Christ and rely on Him.

Are we anxious in our hearts? Even after we pray, we may still feel anxious. This tells us we aren’t trusting and relying on God enough, because this verse tells us whoever believes won’t act hastily, as Christ is a sure foundation. He is a sure source of reliance. 

If we truly believe in Him and rely on Him, then we ought to calm our anxious hearts. We have to entrust all the unknowns to God. God doesn’t immediately solve our sufferings at times. He does that to test our faith, and sometimes for us to reflect on our ways. 

Or perhaps sometimes, it’s an opportunity for us to cultivate *true* faith. There are many people who believe in God but don’t rely on God. Some people say they rely on God and yet feel anxious and fearful in their hearts. We all have times we are anxious and fearful as we don’t know what’s going to happen. 

But who can help us not to be fearful and anxious? Only God. Only when we truly rely on God and entrust all things to Him can we calm our hearts down. But this is something we have to *learn*. This kind of faith doesn’t form automatically just by hearing the word of God. Yes, we start to form faith but it’s not a strong one. 

How can we strengthen our faith? We think back about the grace of God and count our blessings from God. We hold on to the word of God. This becomes our comfort and strength and allows our heart to be quietened. And then, we will see our faith naturally being strengthened. 

When we believe in God, we won’t be hasty. We have to be patient to wait for God’s time and for His will. Just like the hymn: in some way or other, the Lord will provide. Or another hymn: I don’t know about tomorrow, but I know who holds my hand. The speaker would have chosen hymn 485, but since this sermon is streamed, he cannot choose hymns beyond hymn 469.
