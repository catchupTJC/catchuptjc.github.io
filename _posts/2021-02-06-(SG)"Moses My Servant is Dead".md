Summary:
The book of Joshua begins by saying in v1 - “After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord”. The first message from this book is the death of Moses. When God opened His mouth, He started by saying, “Moses, My servant is dead.” What is the significance of the death of Moses?
Moses was one whom God spoke to face to face. He was different from all the other prophets. How was Joshua supposed to succeed Moses and lead the Israelites in their conquest of Canaan?

196: Dwelling in Beulah Land

Joshua 1:1-2  
*After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel.*


The book of Joshua begins by saying in v1 - “After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord”. The first message from this book is the death of Moses. When God opened His mouth, He started by saying, “Moses, My servant is dead.” 

The death of Moses happened probably about 1 month before God talked to Joshua because we read that the people mourned for Moses 30 days. This is still fresh in the memory of these people. They needed no reminders. They were with Moses for 40 years and he was important to them; his death and absence would be deeply felt by them. There was no need to make this statement that Moses was dead but God wanted to impress this on Joshua. Hence, He said, “Moses, My servant is dead.” 

Joshua was designated to be the successor of Moses even before he passed on. The death of Moses was inevitable and something Joshua had to keep in mind because he was ordained for the purpose of succeeding Moses after his death. Why was Joshua chosen to succeed Moses even before he died? Was it because Moses at that time was too old to lead the people? 

Deuteronomy 34:7  
*Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished*


Joshua was selected by God to take over Moses’ position as leader over the Israelites not because Moses was too old. He was old but his eyes were not dim. Right there on the mountain, he saw the whole of the promised land. In fact, his eyes were so sharp he could pierce through the clouds to see the real promised land above. Here says his strength was not weakened too. Just before Moses died, he could climb up the mountain! But God wanted him to die before the people were led across River Jordan to the promised land. 

Deuteronomy 31:1-2  
*Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. And he said to them: “I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. Also the LORD has said to me, You shall not cross over this Jordan.’*


Nevertheless, Moses was humble and said that his strength was not as before. Joshua did not succeed Moses because of his advanced age.

The emphasis is that the Lord Himself will be the leader. 

Deuteronomy 31:3  
*The LORD your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself crosses over before you, just as the LORD has said.*

Deuteronomy 31:8  
*And the LORD, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.”*


Moses died before Israel crossed Jordan. 

Let’s talk about who Moses was. When God said, “My servant is dead,” the whole impact will only be understood if we know who he is. 

## Who was Moses?

### Different from other prophets

Deuteronomy 34:5-7  
*So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day. Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished.*

Deuteronomy 34:10  
*But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,*


Here it says that Moses was unique. Not only did he die healthy and also had God bury him (very unique because who in this world has been buried by God personally? The speaker dares not ask for this. Moses walked to his burial place and died), but throughout his years of serving God, he had an intimate relationship with God. Moses knew God face to face. However, God knows all of us and He knows us completely. Nevertheless, the Bible still chose to describe that God knew him face to face. 

This is special because there was no prophet like him. This is because Moses and God had an intimate relationship where Moses frequently spoke to God face to face. If God wants to know a person, He will know that person. But only with Moses, He chose to know him face to face. 

Numbers 12:8  
*I speak with him face to face,  
Even plainly, and not in dark sayings;  
And he sees the form of the LORD.  
Why then were you not afraid  
To speak against My servant Moses?*


God compared Moses with all the other prophets. He is unique in how God gave him the message. Because he had a deep relationship with God, Numbers 12 said that God spoke to him ‘mouth to mouth’ (in Mandarin and Hebrews version). 

Here also says that Moses saw God’s form. God spoke to other prophets via dreams or visions(/daydream). 

Even if you see prophets talking to God as if it was a conversation, this was not mouth to mouth. Perhaps you may say their interactions are similar to Moses and God’s, as other prophets also seem to be conversing with God. However, those were visions and you don’t control the visions. Visions are exactly like dreams except that you’re not sleeping. Visions are all controlled by God - all that you say, ask and receive in the vision are all controlled by God too! Dreams feel real but when you wake up you’d realise that the dream was given TO you. For these other prophets, when God wanted to give them a message, they are like recorded messages and God gives them the message. Hence though it seems that the prophets asked and God answered, they were all ‘prerecorded’. 

Moses was unique in that sense and when faced with a problem, he would just go before God and God would speak to him from the ark of the covenant. 

Now that Moses was dead, wouldn’t the people be at a loss? They always had this someone who they could go to (i.e. Moses), “Hey, you go ask God this!” When God wants to appear and speak to them, they could push Moses to go. 

When there is nothing to eat, drink, when they were bitten by snakes, when there was a sea before them, they just had to cry out to Moses and Moses would always have an answer for them. Now that Moses was dead, what were they going to do? Perhaps it may still seem to us that the people were not at a loss because of the death of Moses. But remember Exodus 32? Why did the people ask Aaron to make a golden calf for them?

Exodus 32:1  
*Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”*


### Who led them out of Egypt?

Many of us would say God, but the Israelites said Moses. Because Moses was not there at that time, they now needed an image. Humans have very imaginative minds, they could imagine that it was the golden calf that led them out of Egypt. They wanted a god to continue to lead them in a forward journey. 

Exodus 32:4-5  
*And he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf.  
Then they said, “This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!”  
So when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD.”*


Even if you say, “It was god who brought me out of Egypt,” who is this god? Previously it was Moses, but now it is the golden calf. In their mind, they need a physical man or idol. Then, the next day would be a feast to the ‘lord’, the god that brought them out of Egypt (which presently was the golden calf). Moses and the golden calf became proxies for God. Even God knew that that was how the people saw him (v7 - God said to Moses “For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.”).

Yes, God was the one who led them out of Egypt, but God works through man. Man is so weak and holy while God is so holy and mighty. As much as God wants to draw near to man, man can not take the holiness of God. The speaker doesn’t know if many would know of the comic character named Doctor Manhattan (the bluish radioactive guy who couldn’t get close to people. He had to live far away from the moon). 

Unlike that comic character, God wants to draw near to us! He told Moses, “Once you get out of Egypt, come to this mountain.” God said that He would come down to the mountain. But first, He would have to envelop it with a thick cloud. When God came down on the mountain, what was inside the thick cloud? They could see a fire burning it but the thick cloud covered the fire. There was lightning and thunder and when God spoke, it was so piercing and loud. God said that Moses had to make boundaries on the mountain. Only when you hear the long blast on the trumpet, then the people have to come near. Moreover, they have to cleanse themselves for 3 days before that. But still, even when they came near, they could not come too near. 

The boundaries in church that you see today are not to prevent you from coming near to the pulpit but so that the 2 zones don’t mix because of the Covid-19 measures. But in those days, the boundaries were for the people to not touch the mountain. This is the uneasy and inconvenient relationship that God wants to have to man. He wanted the people to go close to Him at the mountain but He has to take great pains to protect them from Himself. His desires for the people to draw close to Him and His desire to draw close to them was so strong that He needed to do something else. One day God said, “I will not continue to meet you like that. You make Me a tent!” 

Moses did a simple tent (perhaps squarish) and that tent was placed outside the tent where the people dwelt. Whenever Moses wanted to meet God, he would just go for the tent that is far away from the people’s tent (Exodus 33). Then, he goes to talk to God. Moses must have a fantastic memory because whatever God tells him, he would walk a distance back to the tent and relay the message. At least, the distance was closer than climbing up the mountain. After some time, God says that He doesn’t want to live so far away from the tent, He wants to live in their midst. But He has to protect the people from Himself. It was an uneasy relationship of “come near, but not too near”. 

Hence, He said, “Build me a holy dwelling place - the Sanctuary. The furniture and design must be carefully in accordance with what I tell you because within that design is the protection for My people!” In that design is God’s salvation plan. Hence, that design was followed and the Tabernacle was built. Not only was the design of the Tabernacle a source of protection from the people, there were rituals around it to protect the people. When God went in their midst, the messy camp became very orderly. God said that they have to dwell with their families - in the north, south, east and west. This is just like how when God enters our lives, everything becomes orderly. But, they have to remain a distance from the Tabernacle. 

There is also the tribe of Levi, including the priests. Because they were a little more resilient to God’s holiness (as their lives were specially designed/dictated by God to be more holy). What were they supposed to do? Their tents surrounded the tabernacle to protect the rest of the congregation. The glory of God then came into the Tabernacle. In the Tabernacle, the deepest part is called the Holy of Holies. You enter the court, then the holy pace. Then the Holy of Holies. Nobody could enter the Holy of Holies, only the High Priest could enter once a year. But Moses was unique and could enter.

## How was Joshua supposed to succeed Moses?

Moses was so unique he spoke to God mouth to mouth. But now, Moses was dead! Joshua was charged to take the people across Jordan to the promised land. But God says that He will be with His people as well. 

Joshua 1:2  
*“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel.*

Joshua 1:5   
*No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you.*

Joshua 1:9  
*Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”*


But, since Moses was unique, Joshua could no way be Moses’ substitute! Remember the different levels in God’s interactions with man? Only Moses was that unique who could speak mouth to mouth and face to face with God. 

Since Joshua couldn’t really be Moses’ substitute, his leadership was at a different level. How could the people be led properly? 

Joshua 1:7-8  
*Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.*

God says to not be afraid but there is a prerequisite - the Law must not depart from your mouth! If the book of Law does not depart from your mouth, I will not depart from you. This is because the book of the Law comes directly from the mouth of God! 

The first 5 books of the Bible are named the Books of Moses. They are the product of God’s mouth to mouth revelation to Moses. Hence, God told Joshua, “You have to read this book of Law. You have to memorize the Book of Law.”

In those days, to memorise things is to read aloud. In a way, God is asking Joshua how to know God intimately as well because these are the very words God spoke to Moses. Now, Joshua is supposed to repeat the very words in his mouth. To have the Word of God in his mouth is to ensure that God is with you, and this is what God promised to Joshua!

The core of the Old Testament is the first 5 Books of Moses. Moses was not supposed to be a proxy for God and so it is good that he was dead. Hence, God says, “Moses My servant is dead. But I’m still alive and so My promise still stands. Moses is dead but there is still work to do! Moses is My servant and is dead, but My work shall be indeed taken by you! And you shall have My words in your mouth.”

This is how God continues to lead His people. His words were in the mouth of Joshua the leader. Joshua takes the place of Moses as the communicator of God’s instructions. In the days of Moses, everything was not communicated yet. Therefore, they needed Moses to receive these from God. But now everything is written and they have the Law. They have God’s words and His words are in there. If you obey the will of God, nothing will go wrong. Joshua 1 says that nobody will be able to stand before him because He is with him, just as how He was with Moses. That is only if My words are in your mouth. 

Joshua 8:30-35  
*Now Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. Then all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the strangers who were living among them.*


They went to two mountains. One was Mount Ebal where they pronounced all the curses. Another was Mount Gerizim where they pronounced all the blessings. In Mount Ebal they had to write all the Laws on the rock. 

Joshua 22:5  
*But take careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”*


Moses was always associated with the Law of God because the Law now takes over Moses. 

Joshua 23:6  
*Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left*


Moses was dead but the Law was with them. The full guidance of God (the Law) was with them. There was nothing to fear. As long as the Law is in your mouths and hearts, God is with you. That was how Joshua led the people with the Law of God in his mouth. Because of that, he was successful. 

Joshua 24:29-31  
*Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old. And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.  
Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had known all the works of the LORD which He had done for Israel.*


When it came to the end of Joshua’s life. Joshua also died and was buried, but the Law was still with them. They had already inherited Canaan. The land was divided among the tribes. The very interesting thing mentioned with the burial of Joshua was his burial with the bones of Joseph. 

Joshua 24:32   
*The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph.*


When we read the Exodus story, we can only come to a closure at this point. Because they went out of Egypt, but into where? Into Canaan land. With the death of Joshua, we are told that Canaan land has been conquered. Then, the bones of Joseph that were brought out of Egypt finally find its resting place. 

This tells us the faithfulness of God. Because Joseph told the children of Israel just before he died, “I know for sure that God is going to visit you. He is going to take you out of this place.” That place (Egypt) was a good place. River Nile was so fertile. During the time of Joseph, the Israelites were having a good life because Joseph was the second man of the country. But Joseph said to take his bones out of that place. Why leave such a good place? Nothing is better than a place God promised us. 

“Even if I were to die in Egypt, I don’t want to die here. I want to go to that place where God gives you.” That was the faith of Joseph in the faithfulness of God. “No matter how long He takes, He will take you out of Egypt. He will take you out of this good place to the best place.” 

Here, God did it. The bones of Joseph were buried. 

## The failures of the Israelites

This seems to be such a beautiful story! Except it was not.

If you read Joshua, though the people dwelt in Canaan, not every inch was conquered. Many of the Canaanites were still around. If Paul said that the thorn in the flesh was so irritating he prayed for it thrice to be taken away, God said to the people not just once but a few times that these Canaanites will be irritants in their eyes and thorns in their sides (Num 33:55). The book of Joshua mentions this as well. 

Joshua 23:31  
*Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had known all the works of the LORD which He had done for Israel.*

Was this a good thing? A record of their obedience? 

They were obedient only in the days of Joshua and only in the days who outlived Joshua (those who saw the great works of God when they were brought out of Egypt - time of Exodus and conquest of Canaan). After these elders died, implicitly, verse 31 says that they stopped obeying. This is true because these very words in this verse were repeated in Judges. 

Judges 2 tells us that the people were obedient only up to that point. After that, they sinned greatly against God. They didn’t drive out the Canaanites. As a result, God didn’t drive them out and they became thorns and in their side and eye. They would be a snare to them and lead them to sin, and indeed they did. 

Each time they sinned and were oppressed by their enemies, God pitied them when they heard their cries. God sent judges to deliver them, they obeyed God *as long as the judges who delivered them were alive*! After the death of the judge, they would go into disobedience again and each time, it would be worse than the previous time. The faith of Israel spiralled downwards with every deliverance as the book of Law was no longer in their mouths and hearts. The book of the Law was to be their salvation. 

Deuteronomy says that salvation and the Word of God is not so mysterious; it is close to your mouth and heart. This is quoted by Paul to say that this is the way we’re saved. But the people couldn’t keep the Word of God in their mouths and hearts. There is a lack of personal connection with God. We see this from the time of Moses through the time of Joshua, through the time of the elders, through the time of judges to the time of Jesus Christ. 

## Christ as the true successor of Moses

### His law in our hearts

John 1:17  
*For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.*

Moses and Jesus Christ were not put together in contrast. The word ‘but’ was not in the original text. It was added for the intention of a continuation - Moses is part 1, he gives the Law. But this Law will lead to grace and truth that Jesus gives. This is what Paul explained to the Galatians. When Israel was a young nation, God treated them like a young child. God gave them the Law as guardians guarding over them. When they grow up, God is no longer going to hold them by the hand and lead them. God says through prophet Jeremiah that He will no longer have the old covenant with them where He has to hold their hands. He will make a new covenant - what is it? He will write His Law in their hearts. When the Law is in your heart, it will naturally also be in your mouth as Jesus says out of the abundance of your mouth heart your mouth speaks. 

On the day we’re baptised in the Lord Jesus, the new covenant is between you and God. The Holy Spirit writes the Law in your heart. You start with obedience. When you pray for the Holy Spirit, you are given the Holy Spirit. The Law is given to Moses but by the Lord Jesus Christ, this Law will be written in your heart. In that way, He brings us grace and truth. 

### Jesus is the very Word of God

John 1:1  
*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.*

It is as if it was written in reversal because Jesus Christ is God. But because God had to communicate with men, we see how God tried to get close to the people in the Old Testament. Now in the New Testament, here says that Jesus is the Word of God.

John 1:14  
*And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.*

Why describe Jesus as the Word? 

For us to be totally intimate and in unity with somebody, if everything you think is the same as he thinks, that is total union. Jesus is the Word and that is what God wants to put in us (He wants to write His laws on our hearts!). While God spoke to Moses mouth to mouth, He later came to the world, taught humans directly, and demonstrated in His life for us to really appreciate who God is. 

John 1:18  
*No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.*

Moses had to be the intermediary between Israel and God because Israel was afraid of God. The speaker mentioned the burning mountain and how they had to come near when the long trumpet blast. But instead of going near, Deuteronomy says that they went far away. When God spoke the 10 Commandments, it went into their ears and they became so afraid. They then told God to stop speaking to them lest they die. And God did and so spoke to Moses instead.

### Jesus is The Prophet like Moses

Deuteronomy 18:15  
*“The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear,*

Deuteronomy 18:18  
*I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.*

From verses 15 to 18, God says to Moses, when you’re around, I speak through you. When you’re not, I speak through the Law. But one day I’ll raise a prophet better than you, and He is the very Word of God. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God. ‘With God’ means face to face. Jesus is the prophet like Moses and He ever lives. 

It will not be “Jesus My servant is dead and now someone takes over Him.” Jesus says, “I was dead but am alive forever more. For a little while you will not see Me but I will not leave you as orphans. I will come to you. I will live in you. When I live in you, the Father lives in you.” This refers to the Holy Spirit.

Brothers and sisters, Joshua led the people across Canaan. If you read Hebrews, it tells us in 3 and 4 that the people did not really enter into God’s rest. Jesus Christ is the one who leads us into His true rest. Moses gave us the Law. It isn’t the historical Joshua that will give us grace and truth when he takes over the baton from Moses. It is Jesus. He is going to give us grace and truth, that is, to lead us into the real rest - the real intimate relationship with God. 

Today it is so easy to have the Word of God in our mouths and hearts. The whole Bible is given to us. It is so accessible. We can read the Bible everywhere because we have our phones. If you're too lazy to read, you can listen. We also have the Holy Spirit. We have no excuse. God draws near and has come so very near in your hearts. 

333: Safely Through Another Week
