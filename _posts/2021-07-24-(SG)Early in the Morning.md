Summary:  
There are many instances where men of faith woke up early in the morning.  
1. Jesus woke up early to pray  
2. Job arose early to intercede for his children  
3. Abraham rose early to carry out the matters of God  
Do we put the matters of God first in our life? Are we willing to arise early in the morning to seek God?


Psa 119:147  
*I rise before the dawning of the morning, And cry for help; I hope in Your word.*

We know that people in the past used to wake up at daybreak to start the day. The psalmist wakes up before daybreak.

Why does he wake up so early?

To cry out to God for help, to hope in God’s word.

How many of us wake up before the breaking of the dawn? Not many of us, unless it is absolutely necessary. The invention of the lightbulb allowed us to sleep later than before. The smartphone revolution caused us to sleep even later.

Today, many of us wake up just in time. For students, we wake up just in time to get ready for school. The speaker had to leave the house at 6.20 in order to reach school on time. So he woke up at 6.10. For those working, we wake up just in time to get to work.

Interestingly, there are many instances where men of faith, like the psalmist here, woke up early in the morning. It was not because everyone else also woke up earlier to start the day. These men of faith didn’t just wake up just in time to go about the day’s business. They woke up earlier than necessary. What did they wake up early in the morning to do?

Let’s take a look at a few characters to see what we may learn from them rising early.
