This is the summary 

It’s the last day of 2021. There are 365 days, and we’re now on the 365th day. We are at the finishing line. In a few hours, perhaps some will begin a countdown. Perhaps some will spend quiet time in prayer, thanking God for the year. Whatever the case, this night will pass. According to the Bible, the days have been given to us by God. As we consider this year, this day, this might, let’s see what we can learn from the Bible.

Luke 13:8  
*But [the keeper of the vineyard] answered and said to [the master of the field], ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. And if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after that you can cut it down.’*

The fig tree was down to its final year of chance. If it still doesn’t bear fruit, it will be cut down. 

The word of God takes time to take root and grow. Just like in the parable of the sower. God knows it takes time. Consider the seed that fell on the rocks. It grew quickly and died quickly when the sun came out because they were not deeply rooted. The seed that fell on the good ground took longer to grow because it took time to take root. 

The master of the field looked for fruits on the fig tree after 3 years. It’s not too short nor too long a time. A fig tree takes 2-4 years to mature and bear fruit. 

(Not a regulation but a guideline)  
A member of 3 years should have had sufficient time to bear fruit and serve God. We can be an abundant fig tree to bear many fruits to help others. But if we don’t bear fruits, the time God gives to us will diminish. Nevertheless, God will give us second chances. He gives us grace like the keeper of the vineyard who fertilisers the soil and digs around the tree. Only if it doesn’t bear fruit in the final chance it’s given will it be cut down. Let’s not receive these opportunities and grace of God in vain. 

How can we bear fruit?

The context Jesus spoke of the parable of the fig tree.  
v1 There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

Some people thought the Galileans suffered this because they were worse than others. Jesus said it was not so. 

v2-5 *And Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”*

Sometimes when we hear someone has lost their life because of a natural disaster or accident, we may think he had done something wrong. But according to Jesus, this may not be the case. 

The first fruit we need to bear is the fruit of repentance. When we hear such shocking news and tragedies, let’s not focus on them but on ourselves. What if it happened to us? Have we repented of our sins? Would we be able to come before God with a clear conscience?

Let’s treasure the opportunities we have to repent. We may not have that much time. 

Also, bearing fruits is our responsibility, not our free will. 

Why was the fig tree planted in a vineyard? The speaker read an article that explained it was because the fig tree’s fruits were sweet. So the birds would feed on it and spare the grapes. This is one possible reason. Whatever the case, there’s a purpose the master of the vineyard planted the fig tree in the vineyard. The fruits could be to protect the grapes. The fruits are edible. 

We have all been created and preserved for a reason. Bearing fruits is our responsibility. 

Just like what John the Baptist mentioned: we must bear fruits worthy of repentance. 

We must also bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit. If not we will be occupying the space in the vineyard and be cut down one day. 

Next, we should consider the grace God has given us. He has given us the grace of time to bear fruits. When we are unable to bear fruits and powerless, God will give us supernatural grace just like the keeper of the vineyard who fertilised and dig around it. 

2 Cor 6:1  
*We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain.*

Paul pleaded with the Corinthian believers not to receive the grace of God in vain. How can we make sure we don’t do that?

v16 *And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said:
“I will dwell in them
And walk among them.
I will be their God,
And they shall be My people.”*

We were all unworthy but He’s called us to be His elect. 

v17 *Therefore
“Come out from among them
And be separate, says the Lord.
Do not touch what is unclean,
And I will receive you.”
“I will be a Father to you,
And you shall be My sons and daughters,
Says the LORD Almighty.”*

To not receive the grace of God in vain, we have to be separate ourselves from the world. We receive the grace of God by preserving our holiness. This requires time and training to keep ourselves holy. Let’s not delay and postpone thinking we have much time left. 

Secondly, we might not have too much time. So treasure the time that’s been given to us today. 

Heb 3:13  
*but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.*

1 Jan 2022 will surely come. But we might not live to see that day. If God doesn’t allow us to live on that day, it’ll never come to pass for us. That’s why the author of Hebrews encourages us to exhort one another daily while it is called “today” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. Let us treasure today. Don’t only exhort another. Also receive exhortation from others. Lest we be led astray by sin and have hardened hearts. 

The parable of the sower describes some seeds that fell on the wayside. There are walkways between fields that are hardened because they are walked on frequently by people. They might’ve been soft ground last time. When the seed falls on the wayside, it may not be able to grow because the ground is too hard. Similarly, the word of God cannot grow in a heart that is hardened. We might think: “It’s okay if I can’t receive the word of God today. There’s always next time.” But consider how the author of Hebrews says to exhort one another DAILY, while it is TODAY. Not tomorrow. Not another day. Because sin tempts us everyday! There are temptations around us that will influence our hearts everyday. Just like the wayside in the fields that get harder and harder each day as people walk on it. Don’t underestimate the effect of sin on us daily. Treasure the opportunities to listen to the word of God. 

Matt 13:14-15  
*And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says:
Hearing you will hear and shall not understand,
And seeing you will see and not perceive;
For the hearts of this people have grown dull.
Their ears are hard of hearing,
And their eyes they have closed,
Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn,
So that I should heal them.’*

The disciples asked Jesus why He spoke in parables. It was so only the disciples would understand, and the others wouldn’t. Why did Jesus want to “shroud” the word of God though? Because the hearts of the people had grown dull. They purposefully don’t want to listen to the word of God. This was similar to the time of prophet Isaiah where the people stopped their ears and didn’t want to hear the word of God. Because people deliberately didn’t want to hear the word of God, they would not be able to understand and would have hardened hearts. 

We need to have a heart to pursue and understand the truth. Even though the disciples didn’t understand Jesus’ parable, they were willing to ask, seek the Lord and open their ears. That’s how they were able to understand. 

Let’s not have hardened hearts like the Israelites, led away by the deceitfulness of sin. Let’s treasures every opportunity we have today to listen to the word of God.  

Let’s shorten the time span we consider now to just “this night”. 

Luke 12:20  
*But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?’*

“This night” not only connotes a short period of time, but also suddenness. As we get onto our beds and lose consciousness, the very next moment, the sun has risen. But we cannot be certain we can open our eyes the next morning. 

The rich fools had plans for the future. He wanted to tear down barns and build up greater barns. Perhaps he would’ve begun construction tomorrow morning. Little did he know his soul would be taken that night. 

Why did Jesus speak this parable?

v13 *Then one from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”*

Jesus came to the world to preach the gospel for eternal life. But this man came to Jesus for help to settle his domestic affairs. When Jesus saw his heart, Jesus said, “ Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.” (v15) This means we shouldn’t work so hard for our physical lives that we neglect our spiritual lives. 

The rich fool had a very simple mindset/thought. 

v19 *Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.*

But how could his SOUL ever enjoy PHYSICAL things? This is deceiving yourself. 

We might say to God: I’ll work hard now so that I can retire early and serve You!

But Jesus will say to us: Fool!

We would be fools if we boasted about tomorrow, because we can never fully control tomorrow. 

Let’s never think we can determine how much time we have left and how long/much we can serve God. 

Prov 27:1
*Do not boast about tomorrow,
For you do not know what a day may bring forth.*

The rich food boasted about tomorrow, because his plan was contingent on him being able to determine his future. 

Elder James also exhorts us. “Today or tomorrow I’ll go to such and such a city to make a profit. Instead we ought to say ‘if the Lord wills’ then I’ll do this and that.” Because tomorrow is not within our grasp. It’s if they Lord wills, then we’ll live till tomorrow. Does this then mean we do not need to prepare for the future? No that’s not the case. 

Prov 16:9  
*A man’s heart plans his way,
But the LORD directs his steps.*

We can plan our ways. We need to be diligent in planning our ways! But we need to be aware it’s God who directs our steps. 

It’s not that: if we determine to do something then we can definitely do it!

If we don’t want to end up in the same fate as the rich fool, we should plan for our spiritual matters. 

Why do we want to use our youth to seize hold of worldly things? Why not on the things of God? Let’s make use of today, this day that God has given us well. Not to plan for early retirement and only serve God then. Let’s seize hold of this day and this night; to treasure matters concerning the spirit. 

Lastly, Ecc 9:10.  
*Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.*

As people who like to procrastinate, let’s receive exhortation from this verse. Procrastinators will find the deadline comes faster than we realise. We end up asking for extensions. If we don’t put our might into doing it, we will not be able to make the deadline and keep asking for more time. 

“Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might”

Don’t keep thinking we have this day, this night, this year 2022. Do it today. 

Let’s ponder with wisdom the time God has given us on the last year of 2021.
