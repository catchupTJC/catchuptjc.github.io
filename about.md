<r>This is a simple sermon note repositary for loving church members who wants to share God's words.
<br>
<br><i>Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away (Hebrews 2:1)</i>.
<br>
<br>Catchuptjc is a platform for members to catch up on sermons from the True Jesus Church (TJC) that they have missed, or to re-read sermons they have heard. (Sometimes after the end of a sermon, we walk away not remembering what we've learnt, let alone the title of the sermon!)
<br>
<br>These sermons come from a range of TJC branches and countries, although you will find that they are primarily from TJC Adam Road & Telok Kurau, Singapore, as well as TJC Subang, Malaysia. Sermons notes from Singapore, UK and USA resemble word-for-word transcripts, while sermons notes from Malaysia are often in point form.
<br>
<br>On this site, we hope to encourage conversations about the word of God too. After every sermon, you will find comment sections where you can leave your thoughts or questions from what you've read. Let us build one another up (1 Thessalonians 5:11b).
<br>
<br>For your convenience, all sermons have been tagged according to themes and categorised by Event/Year/Location.
<br>
<br>Let us make every effort to diligently pursue our Lord!
<br><i>Disclaimer: These are all lovingly typed out by brothers and sisters during the sermon, who wish to share the word of God with others. As such, there may inevitably be typos or slight mistakes. If you spot any while reading, kindly raise them up in the comments section so that one of us can rectify it. Thank you!</i>
